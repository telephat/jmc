distance, beyond a yawning chasm that cuts through the mountains.

Before a Yawning Chasm
    A narrow path cuts in from the west and turns abruptly to the south
just before it hits a yawning chasm. Luckily, a tall ridge of black stone
prevents anyone from accidentally walking over the edge of the path and
falling to their deaths. Branches are haphazardly scattered across the
path, and a chill wind suddenly sweeps past you. Off in the distance, a
burned-out castle stands atop a cliff on the other side of the chasm.

A Mountainous Path
    This rocky path hugs the bleak stone cliffs of the Dargaard Mountains,
following the contours of the mountain like a thief clinging to the shadows
and hiding from the gods. The blackened husks of dead trees lie along the

to the east leads deeper into the ominous mountain range, while the western
branch leads back down to the blasted plains of Nightlund.

it starts to get uncomfortably narrow. The yawning chasm to the north makes
the path extremely treacherous, and only a fool would stray too far from
the relative safety of the craggy cliffs rising up to the south. The path
seems to be approaching a gigantic arched bridge which spans the chasm, and
an ominous black castle sits perched upon a spur on the other side.

black stones blocks any progress to the east. However, an enormous arched
bridge of scorched stone juts out from the path, spanning the great chasm
to the north where a foreboding black castle sits perched upon a bleak spur
of rock. The only choices here are to continue across the bridge or to turn
around and go home. Somehow, the second option seems like the smarter one.

A Scorched Stone Bridge
    Out here, high above the expansive chasm below, the chilling winds that
tear through the Dargaard Mountains cut to the bone. There are no railings
on either side, so the only safe route is to stay in the very center of the
bridge. While the stones near the southern side of the chasm are relatively
grey and nondescript, those closer to the foreboding castle on the northern
side appear to have been blackened by an intense and merciless fire.

The Imposing Gates of Dargaard Keep
    The arched stone bridge ends at an imposing set of iron gates. For some
reason, the gates stand wide open and look like they have not been closed
in a very long time. In a way, this is actually a more ominous sign than if
the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been
carved into the scorched stone walls surrounding the gates: Dargaard Keep.

of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off

    The arched stone bridge ends at an imposing set of iron gates. For some
reason, the gates stand wide open and look like they have not been closed
in a very long time. In a way, this is actually a more ominous sign than if
the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been

sides like a slow companion reaching for the sun. Water trickles across the
ground from some subterranean source. All around here the forest creaks and
moves with the wind, but no animal sounds can be heard. East of here the
forest continues, west it opens up to the main road.

Outside a Dark Forest
    The trees here are beginning to close in on the road but they are not
yet close enough to be considered a forest. However east of here a wall of
trees begins. Shadows lurk at the edge of the forest, making it seem very
dark and foreboding. To the north the road winds up and around a mountain
covered by small shrubs and trees. The road here is soft and moist as if
there is some subterranean source of water.

Outskirts of a Mountainous Forest
    The road here leads through the outskirts of a forest. Around you to
the north and east, mountains rise up above here. Small trees and bushes
spread out on the mountain-side. Leaves and branches are scattered across
the road from a recent windstorm. The wind is blowing more gently now
across the mountain from west to east.

A Path Leading to a Forest

slopes rising dangerously to the sky above. The small trail leads into the

Entering a Light Forest
    A path, apparently worn by more than animals, winds through a light
stand of trees, deeper into a forest. The trees here are loosely packed,
and not yet fully grown. A light mist has settled around you, preventing
you from seeing too far in any direction. You know that to the northwest,
the trees appear to grow more densely, while distantly to the southeast
lies the dark keep of Nightlund, better known as Dargaard.

The Blacksmith's Tent
    This tent has been quickly arranged as a forge for use by the Solamnic
Knights. A hole opens to the sky, through the roof of the tent, above the
fires of the forge. As you look about, you note that this smith has been
asked to perform his labor without all the necessities that a permanent
blacksmith's forge has.

A Scorched Courtyard
    Here in shadows cast by the enormous blackened keep, the air seems to
be unusually cold. The scorched stone arches overhead, creating a narrow
passage to the north which any attackers would be forced to funnel through,
creating an ideal place for slaughter. The maimed corpses and severed limbs
of recently slain knights lie scattered around the courtyard, but no crows
have dared to fly close enough to feast upon the rotting chunks of flesh.

The Great Doors of Dargaard Keep
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

A Blue Dragonarmy Encampment
    A collection of blue canvas tents have been erected here, their sides
emblazoned with the symbol of the Blue Dragonarmy. Each individual tent has
a small bedroll inside but otherwise looks pretty uncomfortable. The bored
soldiers must have been here for a long time since the scorched stones are
covered with a filthy layer of refuse and litter. The sprawling encampment
continues to the south and east from here, while an enormous blue tent lies
just to the north, separated from the tents of common soldiers.

The Great Doors of Dargaard Keep
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

The Great Doors of Dargaard Keep
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a

registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

The Ruined Stables
    Carved out of the keep's solid stone walls, these burnt-out stables are
not terribly roomy. There are only two stalls, and they must have been used
to keep the horses of messengers readily available. It is unclear where the
castle knights' horses would be stabled. While most stables usually smell
of fresh dung, the undead mounts used by the keep's occupants leave no such
waste behind. A small iron gate leads back out of the ruined stables.

of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

The Grand Entrance to Dargaard Keep
    The stale air of the magnificent entry hall of Dargaard Keep makes it
difficult to breathe here. Massive columns of blackened stone stand on both
sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

The Great Hall of Dargaard Keep

great hall. Somehow, the twisted metal still glows with terrible heat, left
over from the ancient fire that consumed the keep centuries ago. The heavy
chandelier shredded the scorched purple rug it fell upon. The charred stone

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

The Banks of the Vingaard River
    The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards the

following the contours of the mountain like a thief clinging to the shadows

black stones blocks any progress to the east. However, an enormous arched
bridge of scorched stone juts out from the path, spanning the great chasm
to the north where a foreboding black castle sits perched upon a bleak spur
of rock. The only choices here are to continue across the bridge or to turn
around and go home. Somehow, the second option seems like the smarter one.

the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been

of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by

force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small

the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been
carved into the scorched stone walls surrounding the gates: Dargaard Keep.

A Scorched Courtyard
    This spacious courtyard is so vast that anyone foolish enough to invade
would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn
across the courtyard, lying near the freshly slain corpses of a battalion
of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.

burned-out castle stands atop a cliff on the other side of the chasm.

A Mountainous Path
    This rocky path hugs the bleak stone cliffs of the Dargaard Mountains,
following the contours of the mountain like a thief clinging to the shadows

to the east leads deeper into the ominous mountain range, while the western
branch leads back down to the blasted plains of Nightlund.

seems to be approaching a gigantic arched bridge which spans the chasm, and
an ominous black castle sits perched upon a spur on the other side.

A Scorched Courtyard
    This spacious courtyard is so vast that anyone foolish enough to invade
would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn
across the courtyard, lying near the freshly slain corpses of a battalion
of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.
A translucent berry is floating inches above the ground. [8]

A Scorched Courtyard
    This spacious courtyard is so vast that anyone foolish enough to invade
would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn
across the courtyard, lying near the freshly slain corpses of a battalion
of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.
