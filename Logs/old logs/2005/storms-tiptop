Xerxes tries to heal the man but he collapses into a heap. He looks up and says:
I am Sir Garrin, Knight of the...Crown. I was captured in Northern Ergoth as
on my way home...You must warn the world! The Knights of Takhisis are
growing...I am useless, my time here is nearing end...Please, warn the world
or soon the Dark Knights will conquer all...Please...

He starts coughing again, more violently now...blood flowing rapidly from his
mouth. Somehow, with his dying breath he manages to utters the words, 'Est
Sularus Oth Mithas', then his eyes close and a look of peace washes over
face.

Steel chortles loudly and says:
You expect me to feel compassion for my enemy? That man would've sooner seen me
dead than rescue me if the situations were reversed. Nothing has changed, my
loyalty still lies with Lord Ariakan. I hear they have captured a traitor...
perhaps you would like to free him too.

for them, you'd think they'd thank me! I guess they don't like kender here,

gonna strap to the altar after me...What was her name? Sally? Kara? Sara!

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

26H 122V 1999X 0C> Your body tingles as the string touches you and then you suddenly feel
a rush of wind as you are transported!

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

26H 122V 1999X 0C> Your body tingles as the string touches you and then you suddenly feel
a rush of wind as you are transported!

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.
The innkeeper smiles as you enter, and motions you to come closer so as

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

Falling From the Heavens

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
