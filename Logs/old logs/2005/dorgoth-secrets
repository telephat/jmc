growing...I am useless, my time here is nearing end...Please, warn the world
or soon the Dark Knights will conquer all...Please...

mouth. Somehow, with his dying breath he manages to utters the words, 'Est
Sularus Oth Mithas', then his eyes close and a look of peace washes over
face.

You expect me to feel compassion for my enemy? That man would've sooner seen me
dead than rescue me if the situations were reversed. Nothing has changed, my
loyalty still lies with Lord Ariakan. I hear they have captured a traitor...
