The cover feels rough to the touch as you pull it open.
With absolute dedication to deciphering the text within, you start on your
course through the ancient spellbook. Though it is difficult, you slowly
begin to grasp the meaning of the arcane script and learn the function of
magics from centuries past. With repressed jubilation, you scrawl down the
spell charm monster into your own spellbook for safekeeping.
The aged spellbook quickly deteriorates, leaving only a flaked pile of dust
as a reminder of its existence.

THE WILDDANCE SKILL
Format: WILDDANCE

Because wilddancing requires the dancer to be completely uninhibited, they
must have imbibed great amounts of alcohol. In other words, they must be
drunk enough to be foolhardy.

Dancing wildly and unpredictably, the successful wilddancer will cause
their main target to swing and miss again and again. Other opponents in the
area will have a slightly harder time hitting the crazy dancing barbarian
as well.

The wilddance requires one complete tribute before interruption. This means
that the barbarian must wait a few rounds before switching to another
dance.

Details:
- Offensive skill which causes the user to begin wilddancing.
- User gains increased DEX for the duration.
- May cause some incoming attacks to miss entirely for the duration.

you is considerably less muscular than the other members of the Gargoyle

out from his back that the warriors have, this creature's wings spread
from beneath his arms to his ankles, filling the space between. You also

others. Burned into his shoulder is the symbol of the Gargoyle Clans, a

    Wrapped in a magically aura which the other members of the Aurinite
Order lack, this Aurinite was obviously born for the pursuits of the mind
and not for combat. His light yellow crystal body looks almost like a long
robe, though you can clearly make out a pair of legs below it. Before you
can react, he creates an illusionary bird which flies to you then
disappears. You can almost see a smile spread across his crystal lips
before he returns to work. Carved into the back of his robe body is the
symbol of the Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's wings.

help spell para
Spell    : Paralysis
Sphere   : Enchantment
Usage    : cast 'paralysis' [opponent]
Duration : 1 + level/8 hours/combat rounds
Effects  : Victim becomes paralyzed

The victim makes a save against paralysis - failing means the victim is
disabled for (level/8) hours.  No movement is possible, however, unlike
some other spells communication is still possible.  Note that spell casting
will not be possible since manipulation of hands is essential to magic users.
The effect of the spell is in hours, unless the victim is in combat, in which
case the spell duration is in combat rounds.
(Note: The behavior on players is somewhat different.)

Details:
- Offensive spell which may paralyze the target, rendering them
  incapacitated.
- Also negatively affects the target's ARMOR.
