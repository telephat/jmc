Format: UNBALANCE

This form of fighting is pretty underhanded and sneaky.  While an opponent
has his focus away from you, you can sneak up and try to trip him or
knock his arms wide.  The result is that your opponent may lose an attack.
Unbalancing a person who is not standing up might cause them to have trouble
getting to their feet.
