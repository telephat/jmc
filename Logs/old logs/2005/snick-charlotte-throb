(NEWS HAS CHANGED, please reread)


    Due to some technical difficulties brought on by a DoS attack, the
hardware we run on was unreachable for the past few days. Had this happened
any other time of the year we would have been back quickly, but that was
not the case.

    For the time being the web-sites associated with the game
(mud.arctic.org and mud.arctic.org/forums) will be unavailable while some
more tweaking is done. The earliest possible date these will be back is
