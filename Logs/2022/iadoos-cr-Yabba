Iadoos breaks the chains binding a helpless mahkwahb maiden!

As the thin bronze chains fall off a helpless mahkwahb maiden's shoulders,
she looks around nervously. She blinks her eyes as her fearful eyes settle
on Iadoos. She smiles weakly as she wipes a tear away.

        'Are you here to rescue me? The evil fish men kidnapped me,
    and they have kept me bound here to be their slave!'

A helpless mahkwahb maiden begins to weep uncontrollably, her skinny body
trembling with remembered horrors. Slowly, she pulls herself together.

        'Can you please take me to my father, Darkswell? He must be
    worried sick, and I just want to go home.'
