DRUID'S NOOK
============

BACKGROUND:

Years ago a man, Quen, came to the master druid of Kalaman asking to be
taught the ways of the woods. He learned much and came to respect the land
and all its creatures. After a time he began to question the need for
cities and civilization in general. Quen approached his master and asked
about the need for the cities and why a man of nature would choose to live
within city walls.

Not hearing the answer he wanted, Quen rebelled and left the city to live
off the land and among the animals. He found this life hard and lonely and
realized killing the creatures of the woods is a necessary evil. Yet, he
had still found no need for the cities. Quen took a piece of land and
molded it into a training ground for young adventurers to learn the ways of
the wild and to depend less on the cities that plague the continent.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The fields and groves of Quen are meant to mold the minds as well as the
bodies of young adventurers [1-4]. The animals are there to help you, they
give their lives to teach you how to survive, but some may require a group.

LOCATION:

When Quen left Kalaman he told his master he would head west and look for
something pure. The west gate of Kalaman may be a good place to start
looking for him.
