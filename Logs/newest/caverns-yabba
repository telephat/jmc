Inside a Cave
    A thin layer of soil and moss clings to this cave, carpeting the walls
and ground with dark greens and browns. Gently sloping towards a sheer
dropoff a few paces to your north, the rough floor suggests hidden layers
of rock and dirt that have fallen in from the mountain above. Dank musty
air emanates from deeper within the cavern, filling your mind with images
of fungi and stagnant water. You struggle to maintain balance as your feet
settle into the dirt and lichen.

The floor of the cave drops off just to the north. How badly do you want to
find out what's in there?
Looking east:
Rocks and thick moss alternate on the walls.
Looking south:
Roots and moss line this wall and make a convenient way to climb out of this cave.
Looking west:
A fern grows haphazardly out of the thick moss on this wall.
Looking up:
Mossy dirt lines the walls of this semi-vertical shaft to the surface.

You decide to attempt scraping the large patch of blotched moss off the
rocks. Just as you begin to detach the moss from its home, you notice
movement from inside!

You jump back a few feet and scream...

Thousands of tiny orange mites tear across the room and into the chasm to
the north, carefully avoiding your feet and equipment on the floor.  When
the procession seems through, you carefully proceed to pull the moss the
rest of the way off of the rocks.  Some kind of old device, probably of
gnomish descent, is uncovered in the process.

The Bottom of a Deep Shaft
    The sound of rushing water reverberates from the cavern walls, filling
the room with an ambient hum. Veins of limestone and quartz split open in
gashlike formations up and down the walls. Fungus covers much of the walls
in broad circular formations, light fuzzy moss filling the gaps.. at least
you think it's moss. While the shaft seems to have once led to the south,
passage now has been blocked off by a cave-in of hundreds of tons of rock.

A Winding Cavern
    Cold stone walls close in on you from all sides - at many points this
narrow winding cavern forces you to shimmy on your belly to move through.
Thick brown moss grows like so many eyebrows around the room. The cavern
slopes slowly uphill as it progresses northward, winding and turning around
it self in many places. The south side drops off into a gigantic shaft, the
opening lined with a thick mineral crusted stone ring.

A Dark Lazy River
    Crisp air moves slowly southward in this tunnel, pulled by the lilting
current in the river. The only disturbances on the surface of the water are
caused by slight bumps in the smooth walls, which is odd because the water
is steadily flowing southwards. Soft fuzzy grey moss grows in every niche
on the walls and ceiling of the cave, seemingly drawing in every little
flicker of light.

A Dark River Bend
    The river fights a nonstop battle with the slick cave walls, turning to
the east here. Light white froth and black ripples mar the smooth surface
of the river on the bend to your south, gently babbling like a slow spring
brook. Light grey moss creeps out of every crack in the walls, constantly
moist from the river mist.

A Dark River
    The dark river flows in from the west, reflects off of the east wall
and moves southward again. The ripples and eddies have a beautiful black
sheen, reflecting any bit of light they capture without revealing anything
underneath. The smooth walls form a round tunnel, save where they have been
worn down to the east by the constantly crashing river. Soft flecks of grey
moss are scattered out on the smooth stone, seemingly drawing in the light
and amplifying it back in this otherwise dark cavern.

Accelerating Dark Water
    The tunnel begins a steep downgrade as it heads south here, causing the
water to being to rapidly accelerate. The moss is growing almost
exclusively on the ceiling, it seems the rushing water keeps the walls
smooth and bare. Breathing is a pleasure, as the air is full of a soft
clean mist.

Rapid Dark Waters
    Rushing water crashes into the south bend at a constant rate, causing
an echoing roar throughout the cavern. The tunnel makes a sudden turn
eastwards here, white water roiling in agony around the bend. The air is
full of a chilly clean mist that clings to your skin and freezes you to the
bones. Just light flecks of grey moss grow in the deepest niches in the
ceiling, the rest of the room is devoid of visible life.

exploded after digging into the rich crystal mines. The four miners are

Thousands of tiny orange mites tear across the room and into the chasm to
the north, carefully avoiding your feet and equipment on the floor.  When
the procession seems through, you carefully proceed to pull the moss the

gnomish descent, is uncovered in the process.

monsters wanted to make a meal outta me!'

mission to discover the fate of five miners Haulston had sent on an
expedition to uncover richer crystal deposits.

crazy gnome from the Engineering Guild, Brinklewarmer, whose machine
exploded after digging into the rich crystal mines. The four miners are
still unaccounted for, but I suspect these nasty Bakali may have taken
them hostage. Please see if you can save them. Thank you for saving my
life. If you find the five miners, display this pendant to them and you
will gain their trust.'
