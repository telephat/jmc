The spirit of Shadowstrider turns to you with a fearful look in her eyes.

        "Urtas, it is as I feared. The Bokor Queen's mind is awake, and
    her will is beginning to touch this world again. It is only a matter of
    time before she escapes. Our only hope is to break into her prison and
    destroy her while she is still weak. The others on the council refuse
    to see the wisdom in this. Their inaction will doom us all. But we need
    their spiritual keys to break into the Bokor Queen's prison. Though it
    pains me to ask this, you must extract each of their spiritual keys by
    force. Unfortunately, There is no other way."

A polished bone staff encrusted with jewels materializes in your hands.

        "You can bind the spiritual keys to this staff, though you must be
    wielding it for the spiritual keys to channel properly. The spiritual
    keys rest within each of the mighty shamans of the council. One lives
    in a dark and confusing network of caverns. Another resides deep in a
    lush and verdant forest. And the third member is a recluse who hides
    atop a strange tower in a land devoid of life.

        "Once you have acquired the spiritual keys from each of the other
    three council members, I will let you to bind me to the staff as well.
    Then, you can enter the spectral prison and finally destroy the evil
    Bokor Queen. May the spirits guide you and give you strength."
