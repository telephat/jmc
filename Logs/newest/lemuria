The Plane of the Gods
    You have arrived at the heavenly home of the ancient gods of Lemuria.
They stand before you, wispy ghosts of their former selves. Their tragedy
is just as great as that of the Lemurians, for in destroying the city in
their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly| sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on
the ground seems to be the only way back.
