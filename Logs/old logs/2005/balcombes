unseen force causes the platform to slow down and make a light, comfortable
landing. You get up off the platform and, before you can do anything, it
rises up above to the top of the mountain, leaving you stuck down here.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you
begin game play.  You can read this page at the game prompt by typing 'info'.

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list

2.  You must read the disclaimer by typing HELP DISCLAIMER. You should
    also read the rules by typing HELP RULES.

3.  New players should read HELP NEWBIE. Then read all the topics it points

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players| it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your
eyes open.  Inexperienced players are welcomed to try to conquer the
game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list
    of topics which can then be read with the HELP command.

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players| it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your
eyes open.  Inexperienced players are welcomed to try to conquer the
game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

 [return for more, q to stop]cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
