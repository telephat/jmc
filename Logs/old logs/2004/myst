    We will be having a Chaos Day (okay, okay, Chaos 19 hours) this
Thursday, February 12th. Sorry for the short notification, but it couldn't
be avoided. I will be on vacation all of next week and there is a fairly
large project going on in the arctic code that needs to be finished when I
get back, so right away is about the only time to do one.

    For those of you that dont know what chaos day is, please read HELP
CHAOS DAY. For any questions please talk to an immortal or email me
(aristox@mud.arctic.org).

Thanks,
Aristox

    We will be having a Chaos Day (okay, okay, Chaos 19 hours) this
Thursday, February 12th. Sorry for the short notification, but it couldn't
be avoided. I will be on vacation all of next week and there is a fairly
large project going on in the arctic code that needs to be finished when I
get back, so right away is about the only time to do one.

    For those of you that dont know what chaos day is, please read HELP
CHAOS DAY. For any questions please talk to an immortal or email me
(aristox@mud.arctic.org).

Thanks,
