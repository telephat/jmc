skin corpse
    You brandish a knife which you had kept for this purpose, and begin to
cut deeply into the dragon along its length.  Soon you have removed all the
useful parts of the hide that escaped the destruction of the battle.
    Exhausted from the furious work, you wipe your forehead, and salute
yourself to a job well done.  The remainder of the corpse disperses, which
you barely note, for it is no longer of any use to you. You also throw away
the skinning knife, whose blade was ruined by the tough hide.
