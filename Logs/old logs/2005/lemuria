=======================

The world that you are exploring is known as Krynn.  It is a vast area
and contains many civilizations, races, colors and creeds.  Many tribes of
people are known only from legend, living far away on distant islands, or
beyond dreadful seas that may never be crossed.

Luckily, there is help available to help you explore this vast world, many
travelers before you have recorded their journeys and consequently, there
is information available on the following areas:

A '+' indicates the area is a town and contains suitable inns for you to
rest your weary body at.  Recommended levels for visitors to these areas
are given in parentheses.  These are general levels and the help on the
individual areas should be consulted for more specific information.

A '*' indicates the area has been taken off-line temporarily for repairs.

=============
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Gully Dwarves - or Aghar, as their race is known - are truly a miserable
lot. As the lowest caste in dwarven society, they are found all over
Krynn, living in filth and squalor in places that have been abandoned by
most other living creatures, including animals.  Like all dwarves, they
are clannish, and several clans often live together, following the rule
of their chieftain or one particularly powerful clan leader.  There are
both males and female, though it is not easy to tell the sexes apart.
The females lack whiskers on their chins but have them on their cheeks.
It is said that a large group of Gully Dwarves have erected a large
dwelling somewhere in Krynn and have been plaguing the countryside around
there.
 
RECOMMENDED LEVELS:
 
The Aghar Caverns can prove very profitable for low-mid level adventurers,
the further into its recesses one probes the more treasure one could find.
 

 [return for more, q to stop]LOCATION:
 
These caverns have been rumored to be located somewhere in the mountains
between the High Clerist's Tower and Palanthas.  Acting much like
bacteria, the dwarves strip the Solamnic highway of goods and dead
animals that have been dropped, or in the latter case taken home and
eaten for dinner.

=================

BACKGROUND:

The town of Lemish was once a thriving center of trade.  The capital city
of the nation of the same name, Lemish has a long history.  However, Lemish
was recently captured by the dragonarmies and now serves as a key center
for recruiting new soldiers.  The old mayor has been replaced by a
mysterious new one and all diplomatic ties to the other nations of Solamnia
have been severed.  The dwarven nation of Garnet seeks to end the
dragonarmy's control of this town and liberate the land of evil.  Unlike
most dwarves, the Garnet dwarves are taking an active role in ridding the
world of evil.  Sadly, they are at a standstill with Lemish right now.  A
strange veil of evil has covered the Darkwoods, the forest separating the
two nations.  Unable to probe into the forest, the dwarves now are held up
in their mountain city.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Both Lemish and Garnet contain challenges high level groups of [18+] to
try to unlock the secrets of the areas.

 [return for more, q to stop]
LOCATION:

Lemish is located to the west of the Khalkist mountains in lower Solamnia.
The continent's highway system leads through the city, making it easy to
find.  Garnet is nestled in the Garnet Mountains, a large mountain range
capped with snow.  The Garnet Mountains are located to the west of the
Darkwoods.

364H 136V 5799393X 1348C Exits:N> l captainCaptain Struan was a famous pirate until his family was murdered by the
Dragonarmy. He swore to avenge his family by joining the Solamnic Knights.
Now he is doing what he loves best, sailing and hunting the Dragonarmy's

interrupted him. You can see his muscles tense as he regards you.
Captain Struan is in an excellent condition.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.
The innkeeper smiles as you enter, and motions you to come closer so as

role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.

    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of

the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

26H 122V 1999X 0C> Your body tingles as the string touches you and then you suddenly feel
a rush of wind as you are transported!

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.
The innkeeper smiles as you enter, and motions you to come closer so as
to hear above the loud merrymaking of the inn.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.

the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

 [return for more, q to stop]cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
