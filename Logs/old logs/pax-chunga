Aurinite is most likely training for a position in the Order. His light
orange crystal skin is an unusual mix between leather and plate armour
types, probably due to his indecision regarding which path in the order to
take. He bares no markings of the Aurinite Order either, as that to is
dependent on position. Given time, this Aurinite will no doubt join the
others in defending the Celestial Temple.
