The spirit of Shadowstrider looks up and smiles at your return.

        "You have done well, Urtas. Your resolve is commendable. Now,
    bind my spirit to the staff. Once you have done so, the staff will
    transform the waterfall into a gateway to the spectral prison where
    the Bokor Queen is trapped.

        "Be forewarned. The world within is twisted and dangerous. But
    if you are able to penetrate the prison's many layers, I am sure
    you will be able to defeat the menace within once and for all. May
    the spirits guide you and give you strength."

The spirit of Shadowstrider's ethereal body flickers briefly.

As the spirit of Shadowstrider settles into the staff, bluish wisps of
spiritual energy race across its bone surface. The writhing tendrils rip
the staff out of your hands, and the large sapphire embedded in the bone
flashes brightly as it falls slowly to the floor.

You reach down to pick up a polished bone staff encrusted with jewels and
notice that all of the runes next to the large sapphire are glowing now,
and the staff quivers with unbridled power.

You squint in order to read the faint inscription on the sapphire:

    When the Queen's minions grasp at you,
    And their venomous jaws bite into you,
    And the feverish hunger overtakes you,
    And she eagerly begins to consume you,
    Salvation comes from this gem of blue.

l staff
This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

    This small stone alcove is hidden behind the shimmering white veil of
an underground waterfall. A thin layer of frost covers the pebbly stone
floor, and delicate icicles hang from the low ceiling. The chilly air here
feels unnaturally thick and is difficult to breathe. Besides the strange
density of the air, there doesn't appear to be anything special here.
