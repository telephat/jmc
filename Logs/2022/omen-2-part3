    This square is the busiest part of the city. People of all kinds walk
the city square of Kalaman. Shoppers, merchants and wagons go through this
square non-stop all day long. The air is filled with the smell of food,

Beyond the City of Kalaman
    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

Near a Vast City
    To the east, across some fields you see the city of Kalaman. You can
smell a farm to your north, easily recognizable by the sweet smell of
manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it leads
into a lush forest to the west.

    To the east farms spread out across the fields. The air here smells
heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence has
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The wide
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a
large city.

Traveling the Plains
    The trail leads through the plains to the north. To the south you can
see farms to the east further down the path, which explains the horrible
smell in this area. The tall grasses sway gently in the wind, and the
sounds of wildlife are audible.

Walking the Plains of Estwilde

north the Vingaard estuary is just barely visible. All around grass sways
in the wind gently blowing off the water. The ground at your feet is
slightly barren, as if it has been grazed upon.

plains to the north you can just barely see the Vingaard River. The grass
here is blowing gently in the wind coming off the water. The ground here is
slightly uncovered as some of the grass appears to have been razed.

Curving Away from the Shore
    The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here

The Banks of the Vingaard River
    The road runs to the very edge of the mighty river, before curving away
to the south and east. A small pier has been built along the bank, used by
passengers boarding the ferry that will carry them to the other side of the
river. A small signpost has been hammered into the ground beside the pier.
The road leads south through the Plains of Estwilde and east towards the

The Vingaard River
    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy scent of saltwater to the air, marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the

    North of here you can see a junction of roads. South of you lies the
Vingaard river and the ferry that leads across it. Around you the fields
blow in the wind, and small animals scurry around. The road here is made up
of rocks stacked together neatly.

A Junction of Paths
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    You take tentative steps off the highway through the plains and find
yourself standing on a worn dirt path that leads north into the high grass.

north into the dense plains. All around you, the grasses wave to and fro
with the changing winds of the lands of Krynn. Off in the distance you can
make out the tantalizing aroma of cook fire. Somewhere off to the east, the
flowing of a fast river floats to your ears. To the south, the small path
leads a short ways to the Solamnic Highway.

A Worn Path Through the Reeds
    The aroma of meats cooking over a fire is strong enough to cause any
creature to salivate. The smell wafts in from the north, where a worn path
can be seen taking a turn through the reeds. The reeds and grasses
themselves grow too tall for you to see past. Although the region is mostly
dry, the ground is soft and squishy and suggests the presence of water
nearby. The sound of rushing water seems to confirm that notion.

A Twist in the Path
    The path makes a sharp twist to the west and all around you the grasses

feet, have become very frequent along this branch of the path. The path
continues to wind its way through the plains making sharp jaunts this way
and that.

    The trail makes another sharp turn to the north here, and you can now
make out the shapes of some kind of structures off in the distance. Your
legs have become very tired from your walk through the plains and you move
along slowly, thankful only that the path has become much better kept and
easier to move through. Whatever you're looking for out here, it looks like
it probably lies to the north. To the east, the trail makes another turn.

    The long and dusty path makes for a tedious walk and covers the first
few feet of the ground in thick plumes of dust. In the distance to the
north, smokestacks rise above small structures and seem to indicate some
sort of village in the plains. The trail leads to the south and cuts
through some grasses, as well as north towards the unknown village.

    The trail dips down slightly and the tall grasses rise once again,
obscuring all directions. A turn in the trail turns from its north and

of significance directly visible, clouds of smoke rising from the north
indicate that there is shelter nearby.

    The tall grasses open into a large clearing. Within the clearing are
straw-topped huts and tents that belong to the Que Kul tribe. Buried deep
within the grasses of the plains, the remote village does not see much
contact with civilization. The entrance to the village lies a short walk to
the north, while the path east leads towards the highway through the

The Entrance to the Que Kul Village
    The Que Kul are one of the many plainsman tribes of Krynn. Most of
their brethren made their homes near the towering vallenwoods of Solace,
but the Que Kul saw no room for themselves, so they packed up their things
and made the long journey to the Solamnic Plains where they carved out
their own home from the unyielding grasses. They are a peaceful tribe, only
really known among the people of Palanthas and Kalaman. They have been
known to help those who were beset by forces of the dragonarmy while
travelling the plains. As you stare at all the huts of this crude village,
you can't help but admire the courage they must have to live out here
denying the protection of the major cities, and instead choosing to battle
the dragonarmies on their own land. Looking at the size of this village,
you can't help but wonder how they managed to keep it so secluded from the
populace.

The Entrance to the Que Kul Village
    The Que Kul are one of the many plainsman tribes of Krynn. Most of
their brethren made their homes near the towering vallenwoods of Solace,
but the Que Kul saw no room for themselves, so they packed up their things
and made the long journey to the Solamnic Plains where they carved out
their own home from the unyielding grasses. They are a peaceful tribe, only
really known among the people of Palanthas and Kalaman. They have been
known to help those who were beset by forces of the dragonarmy while
travelling the plains. As you stare at all the huts of this crude village,
you can't help but admire the courage they must have to live out here
denying the protection of the major cities, and instead choosing to battle
the dragonarmies on their own land. Looking at the size of this village,
you can't help but wonder how they managed to keep it so secluded from the
populace.

and tents on either side. Small stones have been placed at the edges of the
road and delineate the road from the villager's property. Gaps in the stone

Smoke rises from all throughout the village and carries with it the savory

The Well House
    An open faced wooden cover has been built over a stone well to prevent
contaminants from getting in. The wooden roof is supported by two walls on
either side, which butts up to the backside of a large structure to the
north. The covering also provides shelter for a huge vat of spirits, which
is free to all and likely sees more use than the well.

between the huts and tents. A rather tall looking wooden totem has been

travel, but there are no wheel tracks or hoof prints. The sound of rushing
water flows in from the east.

and tents on either side. Small stones have been placed at the edges of the
road and delineate the road from the villager's property. Gaps in the stone
border allow thin paths which lead to the doors of flaps of the structures.
Smoke rises from all throughout the village and carries with it the savory
smell of freshly cooked meats. The main road continues towards the west and
towards a bridge to the east.

A Wooden Bridge Over a River
    The arched wooden bridge spans a river that cuts through the plains.
Made from slats of birch that have been lashed together and nailed down,
the wooden bridge is soft from the constant spray of water kicked up by the
river. There are no hand railings on the bridge to keep someone from
falling off, a feat that looks easily done. The wooden bridge connects the
Que Kul villager to the west to a small clearing in the woods to the east.
A haggard warrior of the Que Kul wanders the village, perhaps heading home.

A Small Clearing in the Trees
    To the west lies an arched wooden bridge, spanning a raging river. The
clearing continues within the forest in all other directions until it is
either halted by birch trees or the river. Two tall structures can be seen
within the clearing, one to the north and one to the south. They are easily
mistakable for trees, having been constructed from the very same trees that
surround them. The grass grows gradually thicker towards the east, further
away from the riverbank.

the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The

A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

The remains of some sort of humanoid creature have been reanimated into a
malevolent creature that lurches awkwardly around the area. Once merely an
animated corpse, the phantasmal energy of this twisted place has imparted
the zombie with a strange spectral glow that exudes an aura of fear. It is
impossible to tell what race this creature once was just by looking at its
hideously distorted face, but the look of hunger is definitely obvious.

op jar
You reach towards a red clay jar, expecting something magical to happen.

As your fingers touch the clay jar's lid, you feel a malevolent presence
from within the jar reaching towards you. The spirit of a hideous spectral
guardian bound within you shivers with fear.

Suddenly, the lid bursts open, and a strange metallic mist erupts from
the jar, quickly wrapping itself around you. As you watch in horror, the
clay jar begins to grow rapidly (though perhaps it is YOU who begins to
shrink rapidly) until it is massive enough to swallow an elephant!

The metallic mist around you slowly solidifies, transforming itself into
a shimmering, reflective sphere, and the last thing you see before the
sphere's surface becomes completely opaque is the open end of the massive
clay jar turning towards you and floating forth to swallow you!

Trapped in a Shimmering Sphere
    Shimmering liquid metal curves around you to form a rippling sphere
of chrome that emits a strange unlight. The sphere's highly reflective
interior surface shines as if it had been polished to a mirror finish.
The sphere is small enough that one could easily reach out a hand to
touch its undulating surface, but the reflective surfaces facing each
other make the world appear to be a distorted, mind-bending infinity.

Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards

yourself standing on a worn dirt path that leads north into the high grass.
The path looks well travelled, and appears to be the only way through the
waving stalks of the Plains of Solamnia. To the south you can make out a
huge highway that travels through the plains.

A Worn Path Through the Reeds
    Footsteps of humanoid creatures dot the path as you continue your trek
north into the dense plains. All around you, the grasses wave to and fro
with the changing winds of the lands of Krynn. Off in the distance you can
make out the tantalizing aroma of cook fire. Somewhere off to the east, the
flowing of a fast river floats to your ears. To the south, the small path
leads a short ways to the Solamnic Highway.

A Worn Path Through the Reeds
    The aroma of meats cooking over a fire is strong enough to cause any
creature to salivate. The smell wafts in from the north, where a worn path
can be seen taking a turn through the reeds. The reeds and grasses
themselves grow too tall for you to see past. Although the region is mostly
dry, the ground is soft and squishy and suggests the presence of water
nearby. The sound of rushing water seems to confirm that notion.

A Twist in the Path
    The path makes a sharp twist to the west and all around you the grasses
are cut down making the path easy to travel on. Tracks, much like human
feet, have become very frequent along this branch of the path. The path
continues to wind its way through the plains making sharp jaunts this way
and that.

Another Twist in the Path
    The trail makes another sharp turn to the north here, and you can now
make out the shapes of some kind of structures off in the distance. Your
legs have become very tired from your walk through the plains and you move
along slowly, thankful only that the path has become much better kept and
easier to move through. Whatever you're looking for out here, it looks like
it probably lies to the north. To the east, the trail makes another turn.

A Dusty Path
    The long and dusty path makes for a tedious walk and covers the first
few feet of the ground in thick plumes of dust. In the distance to the
north, smokestacks rise above small structures and seem to indicate some
sort of village in the plains. The trail leads to the south and cuts
through some grasses, as well as north towards the unknown village.

A Bend in the Path
    The trail dips down slightly and the tall grasses rise once again,
obscuring all directions. A turn in the trail turns from its north and
south directions, leading west through the reeds. Although there is nothing
of significance directly visible, clouds of smoke rising from the north
indicate that there is shelter nearby.

The Final Leg of the Path
    The tall grasses open into a large clearing. Within the clearing are
straw-topped huts and tents that belong to the Que Kul tribe. Buried deep
within the grasses of the plains, the remote village does not see much
contact with civilization. The entrance to the village lies a short walk to
the north, while the path east leads towards the highway through the
plains.

Road Through the Que Kul Village

and tents on either side. Small stones have been placed at the edges of the
road and delineate the road from the villager's property. Gaps in the stone

falling off, a feat that looks easily done. The wooden bridge connects the

Your eyes burn for a moment and then feel normal again.
The ghostly hue vanishes from your flesh.
The shadows surrounding you disperse.
Your shroud fades away.
The glow of your skin slowly fades.
The darkness in your soul breaks.
A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.
A hideously deformed creature lurches awkwardly through the area. (grey aura)
A hideous spectral creature looks angrily at you and moans, 'INTRUUUDERRRR!'
A hideous spectral creature massacres YOU with its hit.
The shimmering opening in the air closes behind you.

A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.
A small clay jar hangs suspended in the air.

the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The

jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to

A small clay jar hangs suspended in the air.

op jar
You reach towards a red clay jar, expecting something magical to happen.

As your fingers touch the clay jar's lid, you feel a malevolent presence
from within the jar reaching towards you. The spirit of a hideous spectral
guardian bound within you shivers with fear.

Suddenly, the lid bursts open, and a strange metallic mist erupts from
the jar, quickly wrapping itself around you. As you watch in horror, the
clay jar begins to grow rapidly (though perhaps it is YOU who begins to
shrink rapidly) until it is massive enough to swallow an elephant!

The metallic mist around you slowly solidifies, transforming itself into
a shimmering, reflective sphere, and the last thing you see before the
sphere's surface becomes completely opaque is the open end of the massive
clay jar turning towards you and floating forth to swallow you!

Trapped in a Shimmering Sphere
    Shimmering liquid metal curves around you to form a rippling sphere
of chrome that emits a strange unlight. The sphere's highly reflective
interior surface shines as if it had been polished to a mirror finish.
The sphere is small enough that one could easily reach out a hand to
touch its undulating surface, but the reflective surfaces facing each
other make the world appear to be a distorted, mind-bending infinity.

touch surface
As you touch the surface of the undulating sphere, the strange liquid
metal suddenly evaporates into a silver mist and vanishes. Waves of
psycho-kinetic energy wash over you, and you cover your eyes in an
attempt to protect them from harm.

When you regain your senses, you find yourself floating among strange,
psychedelic lights that seem oddly familiar.
Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.

The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

The mummified leg is a dusty mottled grey. The mummification process has
dried and shriveled up the skin. It feels like the leg will crumble to dust
and blow away with the slightest touch.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

he spe omen
Spell    : Omen
Sphere   : Necromantic
Usage    : cast 'omen'
Duration : varies
Effects  : Grants future sight to the caster and allies within their aura
Extra    : Aura

This spell allows the caster and allies within their aura to see visions
of events a few seconds before they transpire. This powerful ability proves
highly advantageous in combat, allowing those affected to predict when and
where an opponent will strike, greatly improving the chances of avoiding a
number of forms of attack. The degree of foresight depends upon the level
of both the shaman and the recipients of this spell.

Details:
- Defensive aura spell affecting all in the caster's party.
- Increases DODGE_CHANCE for friendly targets, and reduces skills used
  against affected party members by a factor of the caster's CHA.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
