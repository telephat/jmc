KHAROLIS MINES
==============

BACKGROUND:

Thorbardin's forges require vast amounts of copper to sustain its economy
and alloy bronze to make brass. The duergar, seeking to disrupt the city,
have driven the dwarves out of several tunnels in the mines that lie under
Thorbardin, prompting the citizens to respond with a cunning solution:
having obtained the mining rights to the Kharolis Mountains west of the
mountain, they sought to mine the rich copper from the surface where
outcrops can be found. 

King Hornfel, being fed up with the duergar and ambushes on his copper
shipments, provides the mine with heavy security and has hired the
legendary Magnus Ver Magnusson, the world's strongest dwarf. The deposit
the dwarves found is large enough to sustain a mining complex on-site and
only the smelted ore is transported to Thorbardin.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The Kharolis Mines are open to visitors, though one should not take any 
samples of King Hornfel's ore. Young adventurers [13-18] could explore the 
mines safely. Great care must be taken when venturing into areas which have
been sealed off by the dwarves.  Such tunnels should only be explored by
seasoned adventurers [22+], keeping in mind the dangers that come with
venturing into depths where even dwarves will not go.

LOCATION:

The Kharolis Mines are located in the Kharolis Mountains. These mountains
lie west of Thorbardin, and extend as a north-south trending range for
several hundred miles. The dwarves have built a road into the mountains
to transport supplies in and raw copper out.
