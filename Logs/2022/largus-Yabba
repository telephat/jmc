intersection provides a small opening in the forest. Western Avenue leads

forest.

The Western Gate of Solace
    This is the western gate of the city. To the east, you can see Western
Avenue, and to the west, a small path leads off into the unknown. A guard
post can be seen directly to the north. It is pretty spartan, just a spot
to sit for the peacekeepers on break.

A Small Dirt Path
    This winding dirt path cuts through a thick coppice of pine trees. You
can see the odd vallenwood towering above the tree tops and notice they
increase in abundance towards the vale of Solace. The path leads east to
Solace and west to a large lake.

A Path to Lake Crystalmir
    The path continues here, towards Crystalmir Lake. In the distance to
the west, a large lake with crystal clear water stretches in the horizon.
The beach of the lake lies directly to the west and to the east the city of
solace lies. The path here is covered in pine needles from the pine trees
that grow all around it and a cool breeze can be felt blowing off the lake
water.

A Beach at Lake Crystalmir
    The beach meets the forest with a strip of soft dirt and sand. Tall
pine trees rise overhead to the east blocking any view in this direction
and small branches and pine needles lie on the edge of the sand. The beach

mountains. The road through the pass is well maintained and paved with
cobblestone. This is Seeker land and that explains why there is even a road
going through such an unpleasant area. During the winter, heavy snowfalls
can block this pass making travel impossible. South, the pass leads you
through the Kharolis mountains and onto Haven. North, the road leads
steadily down into the foothills and the forest of Solace.

Corner of the Temple
   Tall, sickly-looking yellow weeds grow in tufts at the base of the
northwest corner of the ruined temple beside you. To the north, a
beaten-down path leads through the rubble of statues and tombstones to
deeper, darker parts of the cemetery. The path also leads south along the
temple's western wall.

mist slithers over the rock and weed strewn ground, drawing your attention
to the path which leads west towards the hole and east and south into other
