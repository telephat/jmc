DAIRLY PLAINS
=============

BACKGROUND:

The Dairly Plains are vast fields of swaying grasses and rolling savanna
along the easternmost section of the continent of Ansalon. Past the Laughing
Lands and the Goblin Hills, these verdant fields have been the homeland for
the Dairly plainsmen since before the Cataclysm. the plainsmen are largely
nomadic, but three small villages have been established in the last century as
centers for commerce and defense from the goblins to the north. The goblins
in the Goblin Hills and the Dairly plainsmen have been at war for the last
decade, making it dangerous for inexperienced fighters to explore the lands.
Both the Goblin Hills and the Dairly Plains are filled with mysterious and
ancient secrets, as well as powerful enemies, requiring groups of high level
adventurers to fully
explore.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The road running through the Goblin Hills and the Dairly Plains would be a
challenge for a group of high level adventurers (23-27). However, to fully explore
the regions and discover its dangerous secrets requires a larger group of
considerably greater experience (28+).

LOCATION:

The Daily Plains are along the easternmost part of the continent of Ansalon.
Although technically part of Goodlund, they are separated from the Kenderwood
by the Laughing Lands. occasionally the people of the plains travel west across
the Courrain Ocean towards the Bay of Balifor.

     There is no trace of any road at this point. The ground is littered
with scraps of paper and many footprints turn around at this point. From
this point on, you have no clues as to where the road leads. You can only
see and hear the distant fluttering of wings from the excessive amount of
bats that are legendary in these parts.  The road to the south is
completely overgrown and you'd have to hack your way through.

Maw churn against the invisible reefs and rocky underwater cliffs which dot
its jagged floor. The waters show variegations of blue, green, and brown as
the sediments from the seafloor get swept into the salty waters, creating a
curious abstraction of terrible beauty. Occasionally the waters mosh with
such force that the sands deep below are exposed. A rocky inlet provides
access to the Dairly Plains, treacherous to traverse.
