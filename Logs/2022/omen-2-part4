Trapped in a Spectral Prison
    A faint nimbus of spectral light hangs here, suspended in the center
of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this
void. And yet the pulsating light is infinitely more inviting than the
opaque nothingness that lies beyond its reach. While there are no walls
here, it is clear that there is no easy way to escape.
A goblin dressed in elf skins floats here, immobilized by an unseen force.

l goblin
Trapped within the spectral nimbus is a small female goblin. Judging from
the macabre elf skin robes and kender bone ornaments she is wearing, this
must be the powerful bokor the other ancient shamans imprisoned here. Her
small stature and youthful face don't appear terribly menacing, yet the
aura of power emanating from her is unmistakable. Strangely enough, two
goblin corpses orbit lazily around her. For now, she is immobilized by an
unseen force, but she seems to be quite aware of her surroundings as her
hate-filled eyes follow your every movement.
Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen is in an excellent condition (diseased).

Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen is using:
<worn on finger>           a fused pixie bone ring
<worn on finger>           a ring of braided human skin
<worn around neck>         a talisman of dangling centaur hooves
<worn around neck>         an ouanga of painted kender bones..it hums softly
<worn on body>             a weathered cuirass of cured irda skin
<worn on head>             a crown of scorched dwarf bones
<worn on legs>             some glistening leggings of polished bakali scales
<worn on feet>             a pair of sturdy goblin skin boots
<worn on hands>            a pair of supple gnome skin gloves
<worn on arms>             some rubbery sleeves of mottled troll hide
<worn about body>          a sleek robe of tattooed elf skin
<worn about waist>         a thick belt adorned with chipped minotaur horns
<worn around right wrist>  a bracelet of mutilated kyrie feathers
<worn around left wrist>   a smashed ogre skull bracelet

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this

opaque nothingness that lies beyond its reach. While there are no walls

l queen
Trapped within the spectral nimbus is a small female goblin. Judging from
the macabre elf skin robes and kender bone ornaments she is wearing, this
must be the powerful bokor the other ancient shamans imprisoned here. Her
small stature and youthful face don't appear terribly menacing, yet the
aura of power emanating from her is unmistakable. Strangely enough, two
goblin corpses orbit lazily around her. For now, she is immobilized by an
unseen force, but she seems to be quite aware of her surroundings as her
hate-filled eyes follow your every movement.

Trapped in a Spectral Prison
    A faint nimbus of spectral light hangs here, suspended in the center
of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this
void. And yet the pulsating light is infinitely more inviting than the
opaque nothingness that lies beyond its reach. While there are no walls
here, it is clear that there is no easy way to escape.
An ancestral half ogre spirit is floating here. (grey aura)

l staff
This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.
..it glows dimly

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

l goblin
Trapped within the spectral nimbus is a small female goblin. Judging from
the macabre elf skin robes and kender bone ornaments she is wearing, this
must be the powerful bokor the other ancient shamans imprisoned here. Her
small stature and youthful face don't appear terribly menacing, yet the
aura of power emanating from her is unmistakable. Strangely enough, two
goblin corpses orbit lazily around her. For now, she is immobilized by an
unseen force, but she seems to be quite aware of her surroundings as her
hate-filled eyes follow your every movement.

Trapped in a Spectral Prison
    A faint nimbus of spectral light hangs here, suspended in the center
of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this

Trapped in a Spectral Prison
    A faint nimbus of spectral light hangs here, suspended in the center
of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this
void. And yet the pulsating light is infinitely more inviting than the
opaque nothingness that lies beyond its reach. While there are no walls

with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.

Trapped within the spectral nimbus is a small female goblin. Judging from

must be the powerful bokor the other ancient shamans imprisoned here. Her
small stature and youthful face don't appear terribly menacing, yet the
aura of power emanating from her is unmistakable. Strangely enough, two
goblin corpses orbit lazily around her. For now, she is immobilized by an
unseen force, but she seems to be quite aware of her surroundings as her

Trapped in a Spectral Prison
    A faint nimbus of spectral light hangs here, suspended in the center
of a vast, impenetrable darkness. The light has no apparent source and
is a pale, sickly color that absorbs what little warmth exists in this
void. And yet the pulsating light is infinitely more inviting than the
opaque nothingness that lies beyond its reach. While there are no walls
here, it is clear that there is no easy way to escape.
A goblin dressed in elf skins floats here, immobilized by an unseen force.

l staff
This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

You utter the words, 'Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel'

As you recite the ancient rune words, the tiny jewels on the polished
bone staff begin to glow. First, the emeralds flash to life, followed
by the rubies and then the topazes. Finally, a bright blue ray of
light bursts forth from the the large sapphire and strikes the small
Bokor Queen full in the chest.

As the light strikes her, the nimbus surrounding the Bokor Queen dims
slightly, and she suddenly lurches forward and breaks free of the
invisible forces binding her!

l queen
Judging from the macabre elf skin robes and kender bone ornaments she
is wearing, this must be the powerful bokor the other ancient shamans
imprisoned here. Her small stature and youthful face don't appear to
be terribly menacing, yet the dark aura of power emanating from her is
unmistakable. Recently liberated from the spectral nimbus, this small
female goblin cackles gleefully. She looks around with a malevolent
gleam in her hate-filled eyes, seeking to punish her captors.

way from the ice covering the ground, and are in full bloom.

A Frozen Underground Lake
    The beauty of this place strikes you to your very heart. To think that
something this beautiful could exist in such a horrid place. An underground
lake has carved its home down here in the network of tunnels. A small,
trickle of a waterfall rains down onto the smooth stones at the west end of
the cavern. The lake has a thin layer of ice on its surface, from the
coldness of the caverns. A small patch of blue ice flowers has peeked its
way from the ice covering the ground, and are in full bloom.

correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The General Store of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
