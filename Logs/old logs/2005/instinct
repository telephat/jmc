at the swamp around them. There is little doubt she would rather be

the strong sense of druidic magic that swirls and dances around her.

What is your character's name? start
To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you
begin game play.  You can read this page at the game prompt by typing 'info'.

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list
    of topics which can then be read with the HELP command.

2.  You must read the disclaimer by typing HELP DISCLAIMER. You should
    also read the rules by typing HELP RULES.
    ***WARNING:  IGNORANCE IS NO DEFENSE ***

3.  New players should read HELP NEWBIE. Then read all the topics it points
    you to. Even old players can probably learn a few things here.

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players| it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your
eyes open.  Inexperienced players are welcomed to try to conquer the
game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

 [return for more, q to stop]cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."
-Raistlin Majere "The Soulforge"

Enjoy your stay at Arctic.

You wake from a deep sleep from which you remember little but a strange
soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

    'You will be yet another pawn on this chessboard you call
     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not
     a gift.  As you will see, it can be your curse.'

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS
More experienced players may elect to start in:
     DELPHON     KENDERMORE      NEWPORT     VINGAARD
A stack of maps floats in the void here.
A bulletin board hangs motionlessly in the void around you.

31H 102V 1999X 0C> kalamanYour body tingles as the string touches you and then you suddenly feel
a rush of wind as you are transported!

Falling From the Heavens
     Air whips past your face as you fall towards your intended location
to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Reception
     This is the reception of the lodge, where you would sign in for a
room. This is also a very popular place where adventurers sit around and
share tales of their journeys. Some stairs in the back lead up to the
quarters.

to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

 [return for more, q to stop]cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

What is your character's name? start
To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.
