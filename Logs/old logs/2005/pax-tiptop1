   further inspection it might be preferable to NOT have the word Arctic
   in them. New deadline 28 Feb 2006, 12:00PM EST.

/       =============================================
/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/             1. The icon's focus must be the word 
/               'Arctic' or 'ArcticMUD'. Submit 
/                 one with each of the words.
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be weary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/

   Happy Valentine's Day. Since there hasn't been any news in awhile, I'll
make a general announcement. Bow specs are back--if there are any problems
talk to me.

January 1, 2006

   Arctic celebrated the new year with the first tournament of the wipe.
The style was a six man free-for-all, which consisted of eight preliminary
heats and then two championship rounds of the heat winners to determine
the overall champion.

   While some hiccups took place over the course of the six hour
tournament, the heats were generally successful and exciting. 20,000 coins
were awarded to each heat finalist and 2,000 coins were awarded for each
kill made in the tournament.

   Out of the eight heats rose eight finalists: Kamile, Niffy, Kamile,
Dralan, Tarialen, Sadi, Simone, Omi, and Jenni.

   These eight finalists competed in two rounds of true deathmatch
fighting, with death costing the players rank experience. In the first
round Jenni looked to be in control--surviving the longest and maintaining
the highest number of kills.

   The single person to place a bet on Jenni, though, must've celebrated
prematurely. In the second round Jenni fell off the podium as Tarialen
proved himself to be stronger in his consistency.
