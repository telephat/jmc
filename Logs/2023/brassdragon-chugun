he spe has
Spell    : Haste
Sphere   : Alteration
Usage    : cast 'haste' [char in room]
Duration : A few hours or rounds
Effects  : Hastens the victim

This spell invigorates the victim to such a point that he or she may
perform actions at almost double the speed. Due to the intense stress
this heightened activity demands upon the body, the victim will suffer
a loss in vigor and health for some time after this spell is cast.

It has been rumoured that this spell will not always succeed on targets not
allied with the caster.

(Cast by the 'mage' class this spell will not increase the target's age,
but when cast by a Magic User, Black, Red or White Robe, or a Renegade
the target will gain 1 year in age permanently.)

Details:
- Utility spell which grants the target HASTE.
- Negatively impacts the target's HEALTH.
- Adds one year to the target's age.

Component Casting:
-Vastly increased spell duration.
-Decreased negative effect power and duration.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
