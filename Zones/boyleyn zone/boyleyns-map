A Dead-End Of The Walkway
    The wooden walkway ends abruptly here, the loose wall of earth and
stone appearing rather unexpectedly, as even the lights carried with you
did not betray its presence. The dry air makes your lungs gag slightly as
it forces the oxygen through. To the north, the wooden supports reinforce
the walkway as it continues.

that look very much like dried blood are on the lower parts of the wall and
