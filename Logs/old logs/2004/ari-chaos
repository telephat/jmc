Sphere   : Enchantment
Usage   : cast 'wave of terror'
Duration : Level Based
Effect   : Sends forth a wave of images and emotions from the caster's hands

This spell causes frightening images to be pulled forth from the minds 
of the victims around the caster and then sent forth in a shadow wave 
from his hand.  Fear and despair are sent out along with the images to 
heighten the affect, causing victims to shake so badly as to hinder their 
attacks and in some cases to cause outright flight.
