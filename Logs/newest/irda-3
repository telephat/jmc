knows what the product will be!" Sasha stands up from her chair and
dashes out of her store, excitedly saying, "Mind the store for just a
little while, while I make you a present!"
    Some time later, she returns.  "I put your present in my chest.  You
can let yourself in, it's all right.  My husband put a good lock on the
chest, so here's the key.  My cottage is right across the street.  I hope
you like it!"
