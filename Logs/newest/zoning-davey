Short, disheveled, and kind of wretched-looking, this frumpy hylar dwarf
probably never had friends when she was growing up. She always seems to
be mumbling to herself about some fungus or another, talking about topics
that only dwarves steeped in the lore of mycology might have any interest
in. Absently fiddling with a lock of her mold-encrusted hair, she wanders
amongst the toadstools of the garden looking for rare new specimens.
