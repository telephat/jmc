he spe omen
Spell    : Omen
Sphere   : Necromantic
Usage    : cast 'omen'
Duration : varies
Effects  : Grants future sight to the caster and allies within their aura
Extra    : Aura

This spell allows the caster and allies within their aura to see visions
of events a few seconds before they transpire. This powerful ability proves
highly advantageous in combat, allowing those affected to predict when and
where an opponent will strike, greatly improving the chances of avoiding a
number of forms of attack. The degree of foresight depends upon the level
of both the shaman and the recipients of this spell.

Details:
- Defensive aura spell affecting all in the caster's party.
- Increases DODGE_CHANCE for friendly targets, and reduces skills used
  against affected party members by a factor of the caster's CHA.

he ski spook
THE SPOOK SKILL
Format: SPOOK <PLAYER|MOBILE>

This skill will cause panic in your target, making them more likely to
cower in fear than act coherently. Victims of this skill will find it
hard to fight properly and concentrate upon their craft.

Note that the potency of this skill is strong enough to overcome spells
and racial abilities that help against the effects of fear.

Count this among your other regularly used commands, perhaps practicing
on lower level monsters, and you will improve your skill at SPOOK.

Details:
- Offensive skill which may cause an opponent to cower in fear, and even flee.
- At higher skill levels, may cause an opponent to fumble attacks or spells.
- May also have a chance to prevent NPCs from attacking or assisting.

l shaman
    Looking more like a high priest than a warrior, the creature before
you is considerably less muscular than the other members of the Gargoyle
Clans, though he is still well built. Instead of the large wings spread
out from his back that the warriors have, this creature's wings spread
from beneath his arms to his ankles, filling the space between. You also
get a sense of greater intelligence from this creature than from the
others. Burned into his shoulder is the symbol of the Gargoyle Clans, a
snake wrapped around a shining sword.
A Gargoyle shaman is in an excellent condition.

    Obviously concerned more with unlocking the dark magic of the Celestial
Temple, this Gargoyle looks to have an intelligence the others lack. His
body is smaller than his brethren, and his muscles less developed, though
you suspect that he more than makes up for it in intelligence. Even with a
smaller appearance, you can see an almost literal fire burning behind his
eyes, which makes his appearance even more nightmarish. Burned onto the
back of each of his hands is the symbol of the Gargoyle Clans, a snake
wrapped around a shining sword.
A Gargoyle warlock has some big nasty wounds and scratches.
