Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

An Intersection in the Road
    The long road seems to go on forever as you see it continue to the
north and south from here. The plains surround you in every direction. The
city of Kalaman lies somewhere to the north, while foothills begin to take
form just off to your south. Leading off the road to the east, you also
notice a small path. A small sign has been nailed to a tree here.

Road Through the Plains
    You continue down the long road that cuts through the plains. The only
noticeable points of interest you can make out in the flat landscape around
you is the large stone walls of a great city off to your north, and the
rolling foothills springing up to your south. The road continues to your
north and south, into the towering foothills.

Road Through the Towering Foothills
    You continue to climb through the rising foothills which the road
passes through. The road ascends upwards towards the higher foothills, and
to the north towards the smaller foothills there, leading into a road

plains in the distance to the north, past the foothills.

Climbing the Khalkist Foothills
    The road has exited the lush foothills and plains to your north, and
you can now see the landscape around you has changed to a parched, dry
terrain. You have now reached the Khalkist foothills, which seem to
transform to a more jagged and mountainous surrounding to your south. The
road extends to the south into the Khalkists, and also down into the
greener foothills.

of you. The Khalkist foothills not only show little vegetation, but they
are eerie with silence as you seem to be alone in this rugged wasteland.
The road continues through the Khalkists to the north, and also climbs up
higher into the Khalkist foothills towards the south.

long road. Occasionally you can hear the muffled sounds of what you think
is a crow or perhaps some other bird. Other than that you can't hear any
other sounds of wildlife. The road continues on to the north and south

A Crossroads in the Khalkist Foothills
    You arrive upon a three way crossroads in the foothills of the
Khalkists. As you examine the three different directions, you only notice
that each passes through the barren Khalkist foothills, which spread all
around you. Other than these foothills, you are only able to make out some
large mountains in each direction which further block your view of anything
beyond them.

Skirting the Walls of Jelek
    The decaying city of Jelek, just over the walls to the east, is filled
with the cries of slavers and mercenaries moving their slaves about. The
citizenry quickly hurries past, careful to avoid the gaze of the dragonarmy
and the slavers. The buildings are made of roughly hewn stone and clay,
hardly any timber can be seen on the buildings.

circles the city. The road widens to the east and west, while winding next
to the crumbling walls to the north. East, the road leads through a pass in
the Khalkists towards Neraka. West, the way looks less traveled, leading

Near a Crumbling City
    The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small

Atop a Sharp Descent
    A stiff breeze is the only thing to the east, as the mountain drops off
sharper than a knife could cut. Far below birds are visible, circling to
find anything stupid enough to be blown off the mountain. The road travels
pretty much straight down, zigzagging down a path literally cut out of the
rock. To the west it stays level a bit, but promises a similar descent.

    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

A Path Through the Khalkists
    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.
A massive cactus grows here, casting a large shadow.

A Coast Road
    You find yourself on a road that roughly follows the shores of the
Blood Bay, a bay near the town of Ogreshield. The city itself has a
reputation of trading with pirates, and judging from the ransacked wagons
that lay in shambles around you, they are probably true. A few pines grow
about, though the real view is that of the bay itself whose crimson waters
reflect the light in a much different way than clearer waters farther south
of here.

Rockhorde Peninsula
    The mysterious Rockhorde Peninsula begins here. Like an limb extending
from the rocky shores of the Blood Sea, the peninsula reaches out into the
sea here, as if grasping for the hulls of careless sailors. It is quite
easy to see how the peninsula earned its name: mounds of grey rock have
been stacked everywhere, most of them stained crimson on their bottoms. To
the west you can barely make out the road from which you came. This place
seems to be shrouded in a strange grey mist, almost as grey as the rocks.

Blood Bay
    The jutting stones of Rockhorde Peninsula can be seen to the west,
creating protection for Blood Bay. Pink-white foam spins in uncontrolled
spirals, driven by the waves and the winds whipping from the sanguine sea,
creating fleeting patterns of cerise bubbles. These waters, poisoned by the
death and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red as blood, with
a high salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as well. Dyed by
the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet beneath the
surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as bloodwrack.

whipping from the sanguine sea, creating fleeting patterns of cerise

atramentous burgundy.

The Blood Sea of Istar
    Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be
seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles and keeps which once
dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the

A Dangerous Reef in the Blood Sea

inhospitable island to the south. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the
weight of the souls of those drowned below somehow drags the very ether
downwards. A massive whirlpool lies as the center of the violent sea,
thrashing and spinning with barbaric intensity, threatening to swallow
anything foolish enough to approach its voracious torque. Glowering with
repugnant fury, a gargantuan black cloud lies in the very middle of the
waters, darkening the sherried waves to an atramentous burgundy.

An Exposed Reef
    Bleached white by the unforgiving sun, this outcropping of coral
reaches several feet above the surface of the Blood Sea, creating an
inhospitable island. Nothing grows on its bony soil, and razor-sharp blades
of coral threaten to eviscerate anyone foolish enough to expose their flesh
to its surface. A small vessel can be seen along the northern shore, cut to
shreds when it was driven against the reef. A floundering campfire has been
built from wood salvaged from the shipwreck, but nothing else mars the
ghastly white outcropping.

A Dangerous Reef in the Blood Sea
    A tall reef almost breaks the surface of the water, making it difficult
to sail here: a large outcropping of exposed coral appears to form an
inhospitable island to the south. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the

Sea dark shapes can be seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles
and keeps which once dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters feel
unnaturally thick, like clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally
humid and heavy, as if the weight of the souls of those drowned below
somehow drags the very ether downwards. Driven by the sempiternal tempest
at the center of the waves, the winds howl in hideous lament, mourning the
wrath of the gods and weeping at the arrogance of man.

of red-black water at the center of the Nightmare Sea. These waters,
poisoned by the death and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red
as blood, with a high salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as
well. Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be

Reflection Street and Northwest Street Intersection
     You have come to a large intersection in the city. The smell of a
dockyard wafts in from the north, although no water or birds can be seen in
any direction. The somber path of Reflection Street stretches southward,
and Northwest Street leads east around the northern side of the Arena.
Ruined buildings and rubble to the west form a strange contrast to the
orderly street you stand upon.

Humility Lane and Northwest Street Intersection
     You stand at a massive intersection in the center of Istar. Indeed a
sense of humility is in order, for directly to the east lies the Temple of
the Gods. Through lawns and gardens you can see the temple clearly from
here, and it's the largest building you ever remember seeing in your
travels. Columns towering easily one hundred times a man's height over the
grounds support the domed roof, and inset behind the fascade seems to be a
golden ziggurat that reaches into the cloudless sky.

west lies the entrance to the Arena of Istar, and Temple Street stretches

fought here on this very sand to the cheers and cries of the Istarians.

Suspended Above the Death Pits
     You quickly grab the frayed rope handrail of the walkway as a board
snaps with a loud *crack* and falls into the bubbling mud below. The arena
stretches all around you, but the vision blurs and shimmers through the
heat waves sent up from below. To either side of the precarious suspended
bridge vicious-looking spikes and crimson-stained swords have been planted
in thick bunches to deliver a final blow to the clumsy.

The Arena
     The immensity of the arena as seen from its floor is overwhelming.
Stretching away from you in all directions, the gigantic arena forms the
horizon on all sides. In every direction the sand of the arena's floor is
stirred as breezes waft through, creating little dust motes that skim the
ground. To the east, a suspended bridge leads over a variety of
gruesome-looking traps to a long, straight spire in the middle of the
arena.

The Training Gallery
     The vast, pillar-ladden hall used for the training of the arena's
gladiators stretches out before you. Cut deep into the ground under the
arena, the walls and floors have been neatly tiled with smoothed stone, and
the smoke from sconces inset on every pillar filter through vents in the
ceiling. You are surrounded by every sort of training device imaginable,
and sections of the room have been cleared for gladiator combat.

peaceful feeling descends upon you as you gaze into the garden's beauty.

A Path Through the Gardens
     The path slowly ambling through the gardens widens here, and you blink
as, beyond the statuary and fruit-bearing trees, you suddenly see the
Temple of the Gods. Speechless, your mind soars as you gape at the sheer
immense size of the column-fronted temple. Behind a massive pediment,
spires of pure gold soar into the clouds, and the white marble of the
structure almost seems to glow.

Before the Temple of the Gods
     Reverent awe fills your soul as you stand in front of what once was
the most famous structure on all of Ansalon. Done in pure white marble, the
front part of the temple dwarfs you, blocking any view of the sky. From a
raised platform, ten massive, fluted columns in a perfect row stretch
towards the heavens themselves. Their diameter increases slightly as they
rise, meeting massive scroll-shaped volutes that support a single blank
pediment. Behind the colonnade, two huge golden doors reflect any and all
light, giving the temple the appearance of glowing.

quickly lose yourself in the fluting and purge white stone's glow as it
blends high above you. Directly in front of you, two golden doors three

Southwestern Corner of the Garden
     Gorgeous trees, their branches overflowing with colorful fruits both
normal and exotic, surround you as you walk into this part of the garden.
Before you, in a break of the foliage, you spy a single bush perfectly
shaped in the form of a majestic dragon. His wings spread and long, sinewey
neck curled, you nevertheless get a feeling of everlasting peace and simple
"goodness" as you gaze upon it.
Inky darkness flows into the room, chilling your bones.

Center of the Garden

dark wood complemented by shiny silver and gold fixings. From here you can

Northern Garden Entrance
     The gardens of the Temple of the Gods stretch out southernly before
you, the vibrant green splashed with all other colors from flowers along
the marble pathway. Wide-cut white marble stairs lead upward from here into
the temple proper and lead into the inner parts of the Temple. Flanking the
stairs are a pair of monstrously large statues depicting massive lions
sitting back on their haunches.

Entering the Inner Temple
     As you climb the steps, you realize that you now stand at the base of
the mighty white ziggurat that forms the back of the temple. Far above you,
the levels of the stepped pyramid cascade towards the sky, where they
conclude in a golden step so bright that the light hurts your eyes. The
white marble stairs lead back down to the garden, and before you a mighty
golden door provides access to the inner temple.

"What's the idea of dropping a scroll, you fool!" the old man exclaims,
stooping over to pick the item up. He opens the scroll, frowns for a
second, the looks at you with an appraising eye. "So you would like to
share in the Kingpriest's light, eh, foolish one?" he asks. "Very well,
very well indeed. You've proven your wisdom and your intelligence, but to
me you must prove that they work together inside your mind, so answer me
this:

   "Seven upon seven gods of good, to fight the righteous fight,
    Seven upon seven lords of evil, to darken darkest night.
    And seven upon seven more, to hold both in neutrality's check.

    Twenty-one in all, our Pantheon of immortality,
    of holy places and secret names, and all of divinity.
    White, black, or grey, twenty-one shades there be,
    But only one gift they bring, one divine boon, that you must name for
    me. (Look to the gardens for the key!)"

marble tiling reflects the flickering torchlight from sconces set into the

your mind shudders at the sheer amount of stone overhead. You gaze up the

quickly lose yourself in the fluting and purge white stone's glow as it
blends high above you. Directly in front of you, two golden doors three

Before the Temple of the Gods
     Reverent awe fills your soul as you stand in front of what once was
the most famous structure on all of Ansalon. Done in pure white marble, the
front part of the temple dwarfs you, blocking any view of the sky. From a
raised platform, ten massive, fluted columns in a perfect row stretch
towards the heavens themselves. Their diameter increases slightly as they
rise, meeting massive scroll-shaped volutes that support a single blank
pediment. Behind the colonnade, two huge golden doors reflect any and all
light, giving the temple the appearance of glowing.

A Path Through the Gardens
     The path slowly ambling through the gardens widens here, and you blink
as, beyond the statuary and fruit-bearing trees, you suddenly see the
Temple of the Gods. Speechless, your mind soars as you gape at the sheer
immense size of the column-fronted temple. Behind a massive pediment,
spires of pure gold soar into the clouds, and the white marble of the
structure almost seems to glow.

sense of humility is in order, for directly to the east lies the Temple of

here, and it's the largest building you ever remember seeing in your

So Gor got pinched eh? Blast'd turncoat priests and their laws. You know
'im and me 'ave brought in more heretics for their so-called cleansin' than
any other hunters 'round?" The hunter frowns even harder, and grips his ale
with a pale white hand.

Well, guess that ends this journey then. 'Ere, you might as well take this,
he says, flipping Saur a small wooden token. We was on the trail
o' a particularly ornery heretical agitator when Gor went to the jail to
turn in the cow we caught outside a' town. 'Out 'im tho I guess it's kinda
useless. The hunter curses loudly then calms himself and looks at
Saur. Well, he's yer problem now. Last snitch we found said
Shadow could be found hereabouts and gave us that token, but damned if'n I
seen 'em. Good luck, he's worth a pretty piece o' steel dead 'er alive."

Taking a long swig of his ale, the hunter adds one more note before he sets

back down to stare into the fire ... "If'n you do catch 'em, give 'em a
swift one in the ribs for ole' Gor and me."

The death cry of Shadow echoes from somewhere nearby...
As Shadow falls, a look of serenity flickers across his beaten face.

"You must destroy the Kingpriest, I be-be-beg of you," he whispers,
coughing up blackish blood. "For the love of all that is h-h-holy, you
m-must cleanse this place of his f-foul touch!"

Watching from the doorway, a man in a temple guard outfit unsheathes a
longsword and before Shadow can stutter another word, decapitates him. As
the blood pool on the floor widens, he glares at you, then runs out the
tavern doors.

sense of humility is in order, for directly to the east lies the Temple of

here, and it's the largest building you ever remember seeing in your

The Paymaster's Office
     A wall of steel bars with a huge, padlocked door blocks off most of

head on his office floor. "Ahh, I've been expecting you!" he says,
smilling. "So the great Shadow meets his end at last, the Almighty One will
be most pleased, most pleased indeed!" Opening a desk drawer, the Paymaster
begins to pull out stacks of coins and count them.

Looking up at Saur innocently he asks, "One of our guards
noticed that you had words with the heretic, is that correct? He didn't
happen to have any items or effects on his corpse, perhaps?" Handing a pile
of counted coins to a guard, he looks at Saur carefully, then
smiles. "No, I think were there anything of possible interest to the
Kingpriest that you would have turned it in with his head."

As the guard hands Saur the pile of coins and ushers you to the
door, the Paymaster suddenly exclaims "Wait! I believe you dropped this?"
and hands him a key through the bars guarding his office, then smiles rather
strangely and sits back down.

to the floor ... you attempt to cry out, but you seem to be having problems
staying conscious, which a second shot to the back of your head seems to
take care of ...

red eyes of rats peek out from underneath the rotten straw of a
bug-infested pallet, and greasy light squeezing through the bars of the
rusted cell door paints a weak, greenish glow on the moldy wall at your

bread.  Wolfing it down, he looks at Saur as he licks his fingers.

"Mmmmmm, that's more like it!" he says.  "You know they haven't fed me since
yesterday!  I'm still hungry though, so I think I'll go back to the kitchen and
see if they have any more of those tasty pies or chickens.  I bet the kitchen
staff will be happy to see me, they seemed really excited to find me in the
pantries yesterday!"  The kender pulls an ornate gold fork with the Temple of
the Gods emblem on it from a pocket, stares at it then re-pockets it.

Looking at the sign on the wall, the kender pushes in on the left skull,
causing a secret door in the wall to open.  As he ambles through it it closes,
and his happy voice fades out.

A Secret Passageway
     As you walk down the silent, dark corridor you notice that while still
telling of riches and wealth, the design here seems to be to intimidate. On
the walls, paintings represent the Kingpriest not as the master of
benevolence, but as the intimidating force of righteousness. Strange sounds
emanate from the base of the staircase leading down here, and a
warm-looking room lies to the north.

The Private Audience Room
     Never seen by the majority of supplicants and seekers in the temple,
this is the private audience chamber where the Kingpriest meets the most
special of guests. Three comfortable and expensive-looking chairs are
arranged around a beautiful hardwood table polished to a dim glow with a
huge candlabra set in the middle. Bookshelves line the western and eastern
walls, and the northern is dominated by a huge painting.

The Divine Throneroom of the Kingpriest
     As you enter the Kingpriest's throneroom you suddenly realize where
the painting teleported you -- all around you, bathed in the yellow glow of
the Shrine below you, lies the once mighty city of Istar. You stand high
atop the stepped pyramid of the Temple of the Gods in a windowed room of
solid gold. The only aberration to the perfection of the golden walls is
the massive throne which dominates the center of the ziggurat's peak, light
refracting from the countless cut diamonds inlaid in its surface.
The corpse of a devout guardian is lying here.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A large multicolored portal hovers near one wall of the room...it glows dimly

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
A potion is lying here. [2]
A small blue charm has been left behind.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
