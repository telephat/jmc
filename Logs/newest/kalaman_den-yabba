THE TRACK SKILL
Format: TRACK <PLAYER|MOBILE>

A skill possessed by many wilderness masters, it involves searching the ground
for signes of passage by man or beast. The patient and skilled tracker can
detect and follow these signs.

A successful track will reveal to the tracker a direction to travel,
hopefully a path to the victim's whereabouts. Tracking a fast moving target
can be frustrating, as their position often radically changes, and new tracks
may need to be found.

A young tracker will find that moving from area to area will help them find
fresh tracks, and increase their ability at the same time.

Details:
- See above.
