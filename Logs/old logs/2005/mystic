----------
I was glad to see a common board here available for adventurers to write
their stories, however I was a little confused at the messages that have
already been posted on here. At any rate, I feel the need to share my tale
with all those interested.

My journey started off in the small kender village of Brightfield. I was
actually born in the famous Rainbow Inn in Kendermore although after my
father died in an unfortunate sword juggling act my mother felt it would be
easier to raise me and my younger sister in a smaller community and moved us
to Brightfield. Unfortunately my little sister isn't with us anymore either.
She wandered off towards a nearby human town in an effort to see the ocean
and was swallowed whole by some angry ankheg. A rescue operation was
attempted one week later, however that ankheg ended up eating five more
people before we finally gave up.

Although my years in Kendermore were short, they were good times. I throughly
enjoyed listening to bard tales of Uncle Trapspringer and the great
Tasselhoff Burrfoot at the Rainbow Inn an decided that I too wanted to be a
bard and tell tales of my own adventures. My friends and I used to wander off
to the old ruins in search of adventure and found some scary looking
creatures down there. One of them ate my best friend before I managed
to escape and hid in a large tree.

----------
My mother felt if I truly wanted to be a bard, I must go out and seek
adventure for myself although I think she was really trying to kick me out of
the house. She always said I was always getting into trouble, more so then
the average kender my age. Apparently I am rather clumsy. The final straw was
when I was telling a tale of great adventure at my uncles house in Woodsedge.
His name is Palinobo One Ears. At the age of one, an angry mountain goat bit
off his ear after he started pulling on its tail. His original name was
Palinobo Uglyface but it was later changed to be more original. He never was
married, so we commonly had friendly gatherings at his place to keep him
company.

Anyhow, during one of my tales, I was reinacting a great battle between
Tasselhoff Burrfoot and the great wyrm Cyan Bloodbane when I accidently cut
the other ear off of my uncle. He jumped in surprise and knocked over a lamp
which resulted in the burning down of his home. Luckly he survived although
his last name has since been changed again to Palinobo Burntface. I'm no
longer sure where he is staying now.

It has been a week since that day and with the encouragement and help of
my mother, I have gathered enough supplies to begin my journey. My friends
came with me to some nearby crossroads to see me off. I boarded a passing
caravan which was destined for some city known as Tarsis. My journey is
about to begin and hopefully one day, my name will be as famous as Tasselhoff
or Trapsringer Fargo.
