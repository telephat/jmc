    or: FLY [stop]

If you are able to fly for one of various reasons, the "fly" command will
start you flying.

Note to nitpickers: our "flight" is more like levitation than anything
else.  In fact it is poorly done and has many shortcomings.  Including,
but not limited to, the fact that some death traps are "death by
falling" but FLY doesn't protect you from falling.  Use at your own risk.

If you have the ability to control your flight, you may use stop as an
argument to stop flying.  For example,

    fly stop

will stop your flight if you are able to do so.

feel the ground shake a little and a bright light flares in your eyes. As
the light fades a soft voice whispers into your ears,
'That one was worthy of my attention, are you?'

beneath your feet begins to shake. A large hand made entirely of dirt
breaks through the earth and grabs a hold of you before you have time to
react. The hand begins to squeeze the life out of your body. Just when you
begin to lose a grasp on life a booming voice fills the area.

'Grunch, Halt!'
'Spare that one, put my new pupil some place dry.'

With that, the voice disappears and the hand rears back, apparently to let
you down. Just as you begin to feel safe, Grunch catapults you with a
mighty heave. As your flight begins, you start to fall asleep and dream of
better days.

think about. You take a few measured steps backward and run right at the
boulder, a few feet short of your target you take a giant leap into the air
and splash (yes splash) straight through the surface of the rock. You are
amazed only for a second, because after a brief trip through what appeared
to be water, you are flying through the air again. After a very brief
flight, you are unceremoniously dumped onto your butt. Peering around you
notice the sand and water, this must be a beach of some sort.
