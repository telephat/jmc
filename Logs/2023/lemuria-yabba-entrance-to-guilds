would come to hone their skills to perfection. Now, the seaweed drifts by

The Entrance to The Guilds
    This used to be the magnificent entrance hall to the guilds of Lemuria.
Only the guild members could pass, as the elite guild guards blocked all
passage. Now, of course, the guards are long dead, and gaping holes in the
walls attest to the disrepair of this place. To the west are the guilds

around you, carried by the currents. North of here the street continues, to
the east you can see the south gates, and to the west you can make out what

of Lemuria. Now covered with algae and submerged beneath the ocean, they

you quietly; sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on

The Plane of the Gods
    You have arrived at the heavenly home of the ancient gods of Lemuria.
They stand before you, wispy ghosts of their former selves. Their tragedy
is just as great as that of the Lemurians, for in destroying the city in
their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly; sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on
the ground seems to be the only way back.

The Chamber of Summer
    This room is noticeably hot. Sweating, you loosen your collar. The
walls, ceiling, and floor look dry and parched, and the whole room seems to
waver dreamily before your eyes. The water on your body rises up as steam,
clouding your vision even more. The only exits seem to be a hole in the
floor, and a glowing portal in the ceiling, which seems to draw you in to
it. Surely you are close to the source of this place's great power.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
