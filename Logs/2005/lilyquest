My friend Jibur left Delphon a few weeks ago, on a mission by Commander
Dumgaar himself. He was supposed to scout the Solamnic Plains, west of
Kalaman, for the presence of a hidden outpost of the Solamnic knighthood
and deliver a report of their forces.

He has been missing for too long... I am worried that he has been captured,
or worse. Should you manage to infiltrate the camp and bring me news of his
fate, I would be grateful. Here, take this seal. If Jibur is still alive,
this will help you convince him that you are a friend.

My friend Jibur left Delphon a few weeks ago, on a mission by Commander
Dumgaar himself. He was supposed to scout the Solamnic Plains, west of
Kalaman, for the presence of a hidden outpost of the Solamnic knighthood
and deliver a report of their forces.

He has been missing for too long... I am worried that he has been captured,
or worse. Should you manage to infiltrate the camp and bring me news of his
fate, I would be grateful. Here, take this seal. If Jibur is still alive,
this will help you convince him that you are a friend.

My friend Jibur left Delphon a few weeks ago, on a mission by Commander
Dumgaar himself. He was supposed to scout the Solamnic Plains, west of
Kalaman, for the presence of a hidden outpost of the Solamnic knighthood
and deliver a report of their forces.

He has been missing for too long... I am worried that he has been captured,
or worse. Should you manage to infiltrate the camp and bring me news of his
fate, I would be grateful. Here, take this seal. If Jibur is still alive,
this will help you convince him that you are a friend.
