The potentate looks hopefully at Missacre and begins to speak.

"Our people are a peaceful, happy folk. We keep to ourselves and remain
secluded from the rest of the world. However, recently our solitude has
been disrupted by the arrival of a strange creature of evil. In a number of
clandestine night raids he has kidnapped or murdered many of us. Even our
bravest warriors have been rendered completely useless by this foe, for
they cannot fight that which they cannot see. If you are able to seek out
and destroy this minion of evil which plagues us, I would be most
grateful."

Though not particularly muscular, this tall phaethon's face features a
handsome, chiseled appearance. Clad in a plain tunic and leggings of a
forest green hue, he stands here with a troubled look in his eyes. A large
cedar club lies close at hand, easily accessible should he have the need to
defend himself. Like all other phaethons, this man has pair of massive
wings of flame protruding from his back.
Nanda Lokir, the phaethon potentate is in an excellent condition.

THE WARDANCE SKILL
Format: WARDANCE

Because wardancing requires the dancer to be completely uninhibited, they
must have imbibed great amounts of alcohol. In other words, they must be
drunk enough to be foolhardy.

Once initiated, the dancer will always move to the front of the battle,
deal more damage, and produce extra attacks. In addition, the dancer will
find some of their actions restricted. The dancer will find being hit a
much more dangerous proposition, as the dancer will take increased damage.

Once a wardance is started, the dancer must continue this dance for a few
rounds of combat before switching to a different dance.

Quaffing potions is not possible while wardancing.

Details:
- Offensive skill which causes the user to begin wardancing.
- User gains increased DAMROLL, increased LIMIT_DAMAGE_FACTOR,
  and HASTE for the duration.

THE ASSAIL SKILL
Format: ASSAIL

Assail is the skill of a wild person! Using this skill will cause you to
jump into the middle of a battle and start swinging your weapon like a
crazed lunatic, hitting a number of enemies in the process.

Due to the energy expended while using this skill, it may take a few
moments before it can be reused effectively.  The lost energy will
also make it more difficult for the barbarian to recover lost health after
a fight.

Details:
- Offensive skill which will attempt multiple attacks against any enemies
  fighting the user or their group members.
- Will not attack anyone who is not already fighting the user or their group.
- Reduces the user's REGEN_FACTOR for a time after use.
- Users will find this skill more effective when not used repetetively.

THE BREACH SKILL
Format: BREACH

Known more for their courage than their brains, some barbarians have
been known to dive head first into the enemy, tossing all allies out of
harm's way.

While foolhardy, it could be the thing that saves the day.

You can back off the breach by using the 'settle down' command.

Details:
- Utility skill which causes the user to automatically attempt to
  rescue group mates.
