RUINS OF XAK TSAROTH
====================

BACKGROUND:

Xak Tsaroth was a beautiful city located in the mountains until the
Cataclysm tore the city apart. The city is now in pieces in the middle of a
cursed swamp. The Temple of Mishakal, Goddess of Healing still exists and,
according to rumors, is patrolled by the Red Dragonarmies. Apart from the
hordes of draconians, gully dwarves have been sighted by travellers in the
area.

There have been whispers in Solace that some local tribesman had ventured
into the depths of the city and recovered a precious artifact of Mishakal.
If true, the dark forces of Takhisis would soon be looking for them. Though
not much has been reported on Xak Tsaroth, a city that large and important
would certainly contain some secrets not yet discovered.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

If the rumors are true and the lost city is occupied by the Red Dragonarmy,
only the most skilled adventurers [28+] would be able to even gain access.
Further exploration would most likely require the experience of legendary
adventurers.

LOCATION:

The lost city of Xak Tsaroth once lay in the lands east of Abanasinia, but
with the changing of the landscape caused by the Cataclysm, none can say
for sure if the city still exists.
