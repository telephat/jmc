    This narrow waterway winds between the Elian Isle and the Hallowlands.
A massive whirlpool lies as the center of the violent sea to the north,
thrashing and spinning with barbaric intensity, threatening to swallow
anything foolish enough to approach its voracious torque. Glowering with
repugnant fury, a gargantuan black cloud lies in the very middle of the
waters, darkening the sherried waves to an atramentous burgundy. The
bracing smell of the salt air is undercut by the unmistakable odor of decay
from within the forlorn ocean, the perfume of loss and hubris leaving an
indelible mark upon the senses.

    The roar from the water is dampened by the thick blanket of mist that
lays like a blanket over the rocky coast. Along the full length of this
cliff face these dark waters crash against the black stone again and again.
At some points the top of the cliff can be seen crowned by dark trees when
the mists let up for a moment. The cliff itself is as smooth as if it were
hewn and polished and in a certain sense it has been by these very waters
that batter it today.

ISLE OF SHADOWS
===============

BACKGROUND:

The history of the isle has almost all been lost in the chaos following the
Cataclysm. Once the cherished keep of a Knight of Solamnia, the dark island
has now been consumed by the forces of evil. All that is known about the
strange island now is from whispered tales and strange rumors of gathering
shadow and evil magic. Many of the stories are said to have been heard by
kender and so are quickly dismissed, but others are told by veterans of the
seas who claim to have first-hand knowledge of the strange place. It is
said that the island is of black stone with black sand beaches and black
trees all blanketed in an unnatural mist that obscures it completely almost
until you are upon it. None who have set foot upon the island have
returned.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

If the kender are to be believed it would take a very experienced group of
adventurers [30+] quite a bit of luck and skill to survive finding the
island, let alone progressing further than the Black Shoreline.

LOCATION:

Wrapped in a swirling blanket of mist and shadow the island is not easy to
find but sailors who sail from the Port of Balifor know well to avoid the
area near the Mistlestraits where the mists begin to thicken and the
shadows begin to dance.

Deep Dark Waters
    The gentle swells in the water provide an eerie contrast to how dark
and uninviting they seem. The water seems to move slowly, almost
contemplatively as it eases itself gently toward the shore to the north
where a small pier has been constructed. Sheer black cliffs rise abruptly
from the water and disappear into the blanket of mist above. The waves
crash against them almost sparingly and with restraint resulting in little
noise.

The Dark Pier
    This small pier has been built just off of the path that leads away
from the shoreline to the west. The thick wooden planks used as decking for
the pier have grown dark over time from being saturated with the dark
seawater that surrounds the island. Wooden bollards line the dock edge
while the pier is flanked to the north and east by a sheer cliff that rises
up out of the sea, just as dark and uninviting as the waters themselves.

The Black Shoreline
    The shores of this dark island are made up of some sort of black gravel
that covers the coast completely from the forest to the water. The dark
cliffs of the island flank this bit of shoreline to the north and south
while a sturdy pier has been built out into the dark waters to the east.
Climbing west, a wide path leads up the face of the cliff turning back and

The Dark Path
    The dark trees that line the edge of the path only seem to deepen the
darkness that presides over this island. There is no wildlife rustling
through the brush, no birds sing in the trees and a thick mist hangs in the
air, blanketing the island. The path curves sharply here, leading north
where it curves again to the east leading higher up the cliff into which it
is carved and east where it slopes gently downward to a pier that can be
seen in the distance.

ISLE OF SHADOWS
===============

BACKGROUND:

The history of the isle has almost all been lost in the chaos following the
Cataclysm. Once the cherished keep of a Knight of Solamnia, the dark island
has now been consumed by the forces of evil. All that is known about the
strange island now is from whispered tales and strange rumors of gathering
shadow and evil magic. Many of the stories are said to have been heard by
kender and so are quickly dismissed, but others are told by veterans of the
seas who claim to have first-hand knowledge of the strange place. It is
said that the island is of black stone with black sand beaches and black
trees all blanketed in an unnatural mist that obscures it completely almost
until you are upon it. None who have set foot upon the island have
returned.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

If the kender are to be believed it would take a very experienced group of
adventurers [30+] quite a bit of luck and skill to survive finding the
island, let alone progressing further than the Black Shoreline.

LOCATION:

Wrapped in a swirling blanket of mist and shadow the island is not easy to
find but sailors who sail from the Port of Balifor know well to avoid the
area near the Mistlestraits where the mists begin to thicken and the
shadows begin to dance.

TOWER OF HIGH SORCERY AT WAYRETH
================================

BACKGROUND:

Hidden in the magical Forest of Wayreth, the Tower of High Sorcery is
the seat of power for wizards of the Conclave. Once, there were five
Towers of High Sorcery, but during the Lost Wars the Kingpriest and his
allies drove the wizards from the Towers in Istar, Daltigoth, Palanthas,
and Losarcum. The fleeing mages salvaged what precious books and artifacts
they could and retreated to the remaining Tower in the Forest of Wayreth.

For those who wish to move beyond merely dabbling in magic, the
Conclave requires practitioners to take the grueling Test of High Sorcery.
As the last remaining bastion for the Conclave, it is to the Tower at
Wayreth that aspiring wizards must journey to take the Test. Not every
magic user has the fortitude to join their ranks, and those who fail face
death. Those who succeed in passing the Test may choose to join one of
the three Orders. Wizards of good alignment wear white robes and enjoy
Solinari's blessing, while those who strive for neutrality wear red robes
and follow Lunitari. Those wizards who choose the path of evil wear black
robes and worship Nuitari.

Mages will find it very difficult to progress in their studies without
donning a robe of red, white or black. However, some have been known to
excel as renegades. The tests are often grueling leaving mages forever
damaged in some way changing their outlook on their very own magical
powers or even turning them against everyone they've ever known.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The Tower of High Sorcery at Wayreth is a suitable place for travelers
of all levels to visit. Those magic users who dare to face the Test of
High Sorcery must be of tenth [10] level and have a complete spellbook.

LOCATION:

While the Forest of Wayreth tends to move around a lot, the Conclave
has created a portal south of Solace that allows entry to their domain.

HINT:

The mages of the Conclave have a magical system to help out those
struggling with their tests. Typing the 'hint' command should be quite
helpful if you are struggling.

Those who do not use the 'hint' option during their test experience
will be rewarded handsomely upon conclusion of the test.

DARKEN WOOD
===========

BACKGROUND:

This haunted wood is feared by all sane travelers as it is shrouded in evil
and the undead that roam the paths are said to remain until an oath, long
since forgotten, is carried out.  Those who have braved the wood tell of a
beautiful white stag, visible to only a few, that leads travelers to
safety.  It is thought to be the same stag that led Huma through Darken
Wood.  It is also rumored the wise and majestic forestmaster lives here.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Low to mid level [8-15] adventurers can brave the haunted wood, although
traveling in groups is advised for the inexperienced.

LOCATION:

The Darken Woods lie southwest of Solace. A little travelled path can be
found south of the west gate of Solace.

book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some
