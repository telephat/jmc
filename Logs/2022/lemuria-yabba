Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
You see a thin obsidian wand lying here.
A key made from silver rests here.
You see a small iron key lying here in the dirt.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.
A clan fountain is here.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
A wooden sign has been nailed to a tree here.

Outside the Southern Gates of Kalaman
    You are outside the gates of the city of Kalaman. The large stone walls
rise high above you. From this vantage point you are able to see a few
Solamnic Knights walking about along the battlements. The huge city gates
are directly north of you and a path skirts the city to the west. There is
also a long road extending to the south through the plains.

Southern City Gates
    You are inside the southern city gates. The gates are made of thick
wood, reinforced with iron bars, and are very tough to break. The gateway
is arched, and above you you can see steel bars that can slide down in case
of siege or attack.

Intersection of Vingaard Avenue and Wall Road
    You are at the intersection of Vingaard Avenue and Wall Road. Vingaard
Avenue runs north-south through Kalaman, while Wall Road runs along the
inside of the city wall. To the north, you see the busy market square of
Kalaman, while the city gates to the south will lead you out of the city
and onto the open plains.

Before the Palace Gates
    Directly north of here lie the great and glittering gates of the palace
of Lemuria. Now covered with algae and submerged beneath the ocean, they
have lost none of their grandeur. The Lemurians must have been rightfully
proud to have constructed such an edifice. To the east and west, the main
street continues, and south of here you can make out the city gates.

    And still the main street continues. The cobblestone pavement below you
is slippery with muck, and cracked with age. The fish swim in and out of
destroyed buildings, making strange grunts the likes of which you hope
never to hear again. And the pitiless cries of the ghosts of the Lemurians
continue to fall on your much-abused ears. South and east, the street
continues, while to the north it seems to come to an end.

    The mercantile town of Jelek sprawls out to the northeast, various
stone buildings and slaver tents rise above the low protective wall that
circles the city. The road widens to the east and west, while winding next
to the crumbling walls to the north. East, the road leads through a pass in
the Khalkists towards Neraka. West, the way looks less traveled, leading
off through the badlands to the lands of Throt beyond.

Near a Crumbling City
    The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself winds
off into the mountains to the east, disappearing among the rocky barren
slopes. The Khalkists loom all around, falling away only to the west.

    The mountains loom all around, trying to swallow the weary traveler in
their barren vastness. The occasional wind from the north brings the smell
of smoke, hinting that there may be a town just past a barely visible pass.
To the east the rocky slopes swallow the road whole, spitting it out every
now and then as it passes over rocky outcroppings.

Atop a Sharp Descent
    A stiff breeze is the only thing to the east, as the mountain drops off
sharper than a knife could cut. Far below birds are visible, circling to
find anything stupid enough to be blown off the mountain. The road travels
pretty much straight down, zigzagging down a path literally cut out of the
rock. To the west it stays level a bit, but promises a similar descent.

Beside A Deadly Volcano

In View of a Dark City
    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand

the mighty Khalkists. Craggy, jagged black foothills extend to the north,
while to the east the greener, more rounded tops of the Loft Foothills can
be seen.

mountains continue here. A large, jagged, almost triangular rock formation
springs from the ground here. Probably formed by a once active volcano, the
rock appears to almost melt into the black granite which serves as the
trail.

Approaching the Hills of Khuri-Khan
    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

Shreds of sand-blasted leather and white gauzy cotton hang at irregular
intervals off the hulking body of this maurading bandit. Knee-high leather
boots hardened from endless hours spent tracking victims in the sandy
wastelands move with barely a sound as he approaches. He is girded by
sinewy muscle which has been incessantly trained in the murder and thievery
which define his profession. The grimace of pain and pleasure flash across
his face as he prepares his weapons for battle.

Amongst a Caravan
     The cracked, dry earth has given way to scattered tents and wagons
from a merchant caravan. The flapping noise of tents wavering in the dry
winds sounds like distant applause. The tents are bone white, while the
rough wood of the wagons show signs of age and abuse. The cloudless sky is
pale and almost colorless, bleached out by the constant heat of the sun
during the day and the heatless moon at night. Fine granules of sand whip
around in the air, getting in the eyes and nose. Here and there a lonely
cactus battles against the harsh habitat.

Near a Merchant Camp
    The road is cracked and dry, no plants save a cactus dare to brave the
desert. Caravans have clearly frequented here, hard tracks lining the hard road.
A lone flag can be seen in the distance to the north, marking some sort of
encampment. The large cactus seems to block your way west while to the east the
desert continues as far as the eye can see, leaving this road to be the only
way forward. Up above, hungry vultures can be seen circling, waiting for some
foolish creature to collapse in the heat. To the south the road continues in the

of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying

usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder

The End of the West Pier
    You stand here at the end of the Western Pier, fighting the crowd to
get to your destination. This pier is by far the busiest and largest of the
three major piers belonging to the city, and the immense rush of people
serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of
the Balifor Watchmen on the docks, as you are almost too busy gazing at
strange travelers to watch your own purse.

own safety enough to install this secret exit to the palace. There is a
long shaft leading up here, with a ladder on its side. It is a testament to
the skill of the builders of the palace that this room has remained
airtight through the ages the palace has been underwater. Even after your

of the city, protected by some unseen force.

the east. There is a squat, sturdy door made from solid copper here. Here,
as elsewhere in the palace, the opulent decadence of the inhabitants is
clearly evident in the lavish decorations.
A translucent berry is floating inches above the ground. [3]

    At this point the passage makes a turn. South of you is a stout, oaken
door, and the passage continues to the north and west. There has been a

The Top of the Stairs
    The great stairway from the throne room below comes out here. The metal
making up the walls of this palace has become a bit darker, and the
carvings are cruder and less numerous. There are passages to the east and
south, and a large oaken door to the north.

is just as great as that of the Lemurians, for in destroying the city in
their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly| sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on
the ground seems to be the only way back.

The Plane of the Gods
    You have arrived at the heavenly home of the ancient gods of Lemuria.
They stand before you, wispy ghosts of their former selves. Their tragedy
is just as great as that of the Lemurians, for in destroying the city in
their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly| sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on
the ground seems to be the only way back.

their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly| sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood branches

small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally, the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

Solace Square
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

Eastern Avenue
    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.
