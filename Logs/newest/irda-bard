Thick bronze chains bind this slender dargonesti elf to the sahuagin
torturer's table. What little clothing she used to wear hangs in bloody
tatters from the edges of the table. Her left arm is broken, and six
jagged cuts march in a neat row down her right thigh. Her once beautiful
face is swollen from constant beatings. She struggles weakly against her
chains but she is too weak to do anything but helplessly tug on them.
Anyone who wasn't bound by them could probably break the chains quite
easily, liberating her from the torturer's table.

    chill of his cold touch on my skin.'

A helpless dargonesti prisoner tries to move, and she turns weakly to one
side to cough up some more blood. As she does, you see that much of the
blue skin from her back has been completely shredded, exposing the muscle
and bone underneath. Blood gushes liberally from her wounds. She turns
back to you, wiping the blood away from her lips.

An Opulent Coral Cave
    The deepest part of this opulent coral cave is very neat and seems to
be well organized. A gigantic piece of strange blue leather hanging on the
back wall is covered with little bits of bone. It appears to be a map of
the northern ocean and is marked to highlight various locations that would
be of strategic importance for defending this settlement. Leaning against
the eastern wall is a weapons rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin. In
the center of the area is a large table, also crafted from dolphin bones,
where a few more blue leather maps are stacked next to an overturned skull
full of the little bits of bone used to mark them.

The dolphin whose bones have been reassembled against the eastern wall
appears to have been a particularly large specimen. It is unclear if these
are the remains of a true dolphin or those of a shape-shifted dargonesti
warrior. Either way, the dolphin's ribcage makes a fine place to store
an assorted collection of weapons. Some of the weapons appear to be of
sahuagin construction, while others appear to be spoils of war.

you a word of thanks. He pauses slightly then retrieves a small object from
within a hidden fold in his clothes. He whispers to you "return this object
to me when I have returned home and a just reward will be given. I am
saddened that I have nothing to offer you now. To enter my homeland go
north from Kalaman. The ocean will be difficult to navigate, but hopefully
Paladine will guide your path."
"There is one more thing I must tell you. Another of our brethren was
captured by the dragonarmies, but the officers here feared him and sent
him away to a stronghold of the dragonarmies on the eastern coast of
Southern Ergoth. Do what you can to help him, I beg of you."
With that being said he places a small object into your hand, then slowly
shapechanges into a draconian and walks from the room.
