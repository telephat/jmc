its rightful position. As the altar stone returns to its place, a wave of
peace begins to emanate outward from the altar to the surrounding gardens
and Crytic Forest. Turning, you see the forest as it was in its prime. The
trees no longer seem to scream of their hidden pain but instead glow with a
tranquility you'd almost forgotten yourself. In the distance a white wolf
howls signaling the restoration of Crytic Forest and its garden.
     Before you can move to leave, a group of Druidic scribes' spirits
appear before you, some raising from the ground, other appearing from the

sarcophagus, it falls to the ground with a heavy thud, breaking into
thousands of smaller pieces. The air, dust and stench of decay trapped
within the confines of the sarcophagus escapes into the air around you.
Once it has settled, you step forward to look inside the sarcophagus and
find the crumbled remains of its inhabitant's, Screvot Vlandor's, corpse.
Despite being in the sarcophagus' protection, all that remains of the man
are the few jewels and items he took to the grave with him.

Rent Decay:

    Objects decaying in rent had a few problems up until now. One of the
more noticable problems was some of the items decaying immediately upon
entering the game regardless of how long you had been out of game. These
problems are all fixed now.

-Items that are flagged RENT_DECAY will now decay only on an internal
schedule when the player is in rent. Entering the game will never force a
decay on a RENT_DECAY item, it will have been decayed sometime prior to the
login.

Groups and XP splitting:

    The forumla for groups gaining xp has been adjusted to make grouping
more favorable to xping. This will apply to any sized group, but groups of
2 to 6 will see the largest gains. This ONLY applies to players level 26 or
lower, at level 27 the splitting goes back to normal.

An example:

Group has 1 level 20, 1 level 25 and 1 level 27. Mob is worth 1000 xp.
Old System -> Level 20 gets 333xp, Level 25 gets 417xp and Level 27 gets
450 xp.
New System -> Level 20 gets 667xp, Level 25 gets 883xp and Level 27 still
gets 450xp.

    Those numbers and all the new calculations are done before the
adjustments for alignment. kill_counts and level max, so your indvidual
mileage may vary.

    The numbers may appear a bit high, so I am going to be watching things
and possibly making other adjustments as we go forward.

    The intent of this change is to make grouping at lower levels more
attractive and possibly get veteran players to bring newbies along with
them during xp sessions. Solo xp is still going to be higher on a per-mob
basis, but in theory the speed at which a group can kill should offset that
difference.

Flame on.

      Some new zones have been added to our humble game, while some old
   ones have been removed. We'll leave what these zones are to speculation
   for a couple of weeks.

    We have begun the item changes discussed on the forum
(http://mud.arctic.org/node/1748). This will be a somewhat long process and
should be done rather randomly. We are going about it slow and
systematically, so one day an item will decay like it always has and the
next it will start decaying in rent. We are going mostly item by item, not
really zone by zone, so don't expect a method to our madness. Consider this
your only warning, if an item suddenly decays on you, well thats just the
breaks.

-Gully Dwarves are now a playable race, albeit with lower stats than you
may want. They are allowed to be thieves, warriors and barbarians.
-Qualinesti can now be paladins.

Stat Rolling Changes:

Please read HELP STAT ROLLING for an overview of how the system now works.

    In basic terms, the top end stats possible have been lowered (no more
100 pt characters) and the ability to pick your primary stat during
character creation has been added. The lowering of top end stats is part of
move to slightly weaken players. The drop was not significant, but it is
noticable.

    If you pick a primary stat, your potential total for stats is capped
lower than it is if you do not pick a primary stat.

    Play with the system, let me know what you think. The ability to select
your primary stat wont be available until after the 6pm reboot today.

First step PK Flag changes:

    With this latest reboot pk flags will now be awarded for aggressive
actions, not just killing. The aggro flags are shorter duration than the

 [return for more, q to stop]killing flags. Example below:

If Denmar attacks Hekler and Hekler recalls. Hekler will be allowed to
attack Denmar in peace for 10 ticks.
If Denmar attacks Hekler and kills Hekler. Hekler will be allowed to attack
Denmar in peace for 48 ticks.

Also, case and clairvoyance will always flag you aggressive to your target.

      Hi everyone, in the past decade a massive lengthening of the
   distance between towns has been the norm. With current playerbase size
   maxing at around 100, we have decided to shrink these distances so as
   to make travel less of a burden on players. This general restructuring
   will be a long process that will be starting in the next week.
   Eventually, we hope that you notice it takes less vs to get to where
   you want to go. For the time being, though, just be sure that you stop
   using speedwalks as the roads may change at any time.

its previous hiding spot was too difficult when no one found it in almost a
year. So I have moved it and made the clues more overt. Happy Hunting.

Scouts:
-Lag removed from aim.
-Average damage raised on shoot, maxium damage should stay the same.
-Headbutt extra affect is now stopped if the target is flagged MINDSHIELD.
-Headbutt extra affect now lasts rounds in or out of combat, not rounds in
combat and ticks out of combat.
-Headbutt extra affect slightly harder to land.
-Roar now has a save on each target.
-IMMUNE_FEAR now stops you from being affected by roar.

Clans:
-Promote, Demote and Remove can now work on offline clan members.
-Ctell and Otell permformance reworked. They should be a lot faster now.
-A clan-broadcast will go out when a clan member logs in or logs out.
-The clan chieftain now shows in the clan describe and clanlist symbol
commands.
-The # of online members, # of total members and max size of the clan now
shows in the clanlist, clanlist symbol and clan describe command for clan
members.
-Clan who and clan who all reformatted to be a littler prettier (you can
all quit your bitching now).

Thieves:
-Unbalance now has an easier time adding a STUMBLE CHANCE to standing
targets.
NOTE: Stumble Chance makes bashing sitting targets easier. Unbalancing can
make bashing a sitting target easier than it was before bash was changed to
make sitting bashes harder. I suggest you use it instead of continuing to
complain about how hard landing a sitting bash is right now.

    Please keep in mind that we are in an experimentation phase, so these
changes are mostly a test set. If they work fine they will stay, but I
could change them at anytime. Also, some of the clan changes might do some
wierd things, including crash the game. If you find a crash bug please
report it immediately.

Thanks

******** NOTE *********
    There was a bug such that the game was not taking enough coins from the
person creating the clan. So if you created a clan I have taken the
difference from you. The differences were Small Clan: 5k, Medium Clan: 35k,
Large Clan: 80k. Any complaints can be sent to me (aristox@mud.arctic.org).


This is a long news item and most important piece of it is at the end, so
please read it all.

Clans:
The first phase of the clan system is now activated. You can read a little
more about it in the help files (HELP CLANS, HELP CLAN, HELP CLANLIST, HELP
CTELL, HELP OTELL).

The basic system is there are 4 tiers of players in a clan:
-The Chieftain is the leader. They control the clan in all ways. There can
only be 1 chieftain at a time.
-Elders are the officers of the clan. They can invite new players, remove
players, promote and demote players and talk on the officer chat (otell)
with each other and the chieftain, as well as use ctell to talk to the
whole clan.

 [return for more, q to stop]-Clansman are the meat of the clan. They can only talk on clan chat
(ctell).
-Neophytes are new members. They can talk on clan chat.

The person that forms the clan (using CLAN CREATE) will be made the
Chieftain automatically. Clans have a size associated with them, defined
when the clan is created. Small clans can have 20 characters in them,
medium clans can have 40 characters and large clans can have 60 characters.
There will be a system at a later date to increase the size of a clan, at a
cost.

Clans consist of 3 pieces of data:
-The name of the clan. This is a unique piece of data and can be at most
128 characters long.
-The symbol of the clan. This has to be unique to the clan (but is case
senstive so Blah and BLah and BLAH are all allowed) and is the main item
displayed about the clan, it can be at most 4 characters long. Players in
the who list will appear with their clan symbol in <> before their name
(example: <Jerk> Hekler the Male Lumberjack). Also the symbol is what is
used in the clanlist command to show data on a specific clan (clanlist
<Jerk>). The symbol will also show to_room and in scans.
-The description is a free form text field used to give the world a bit of
info about who you are as a clan. This is edittable by the Chieftain only,
while in peace and resting and not pk-flagged, after the clan is made using
CLAN EDIT_DESCRIPTION.

Right now this is a very simple structure and was designed to be so. We
want to get the bugs worked out of what we have here before moving forward
and adding anything else on top of the system. There are plans for a lot of
other things, but they have to wait.

The first thing to come is a tie in between the pk flag system and the clan
system. The details of this aren't solid yet and probably wont be for a few
weeks.

If you have any questions or comments or suggestions, feel free to post
them on the web-forums, the in-game boards, the idea command or email me
(aristox@mud.arctic.org) directly.

Bandage:
-All guilds with a really low bandage skill (mages, warriors, thieves, dark
knights and paladins) had the max value of the skill raised. Your skill
display will show as you having a lower bandage skill now, but that just
means your skill has more potential than before, your ability hasn't gotten
worse.

Race Names:
-The names of a few races have been changed: High Elves are now known as
Silvanesti, Wild Elves are now known as Kagonesti.
-A new race has been made playable, Qualinesti. They currently have the
same stats as Silvanesti for the most part, there is one very minor
difference. These will change eventually, when we rework racial stats, but
possibly not until the start of next wipe.

Experimentation Phase:
With the insertion of this clan system we are now going to be starting a
phase of the game that will see a lot of changes. That being said, over the
next 6 weeks or so we are going to be doing many changes directly to the
game that we would generally save for the downtime around a player wipe.
These things will be us testing out new ideas and seeing how they work,
making sweeping equipment and zone changes, trying out a new pkill flag
system, tweaking stat rolling, etc. If you run into problems, or bugs, or
half finished things, please report them, but dont get too upset. We are
doing this to make the game better in the end and hopefully have a shorter
downtime around the wipe.

I don't normally announce pwipes way in advance, but I will give you a
guideline for it right now. In 6 weeks, from today, if we aren't in a place
that is ready for a wipe I am going to give us 2 weeks to get ready or wipe
in the state we are in. In plainer english, this wipe has at most 8 weeks
left, hopefully shorter. With that out in the open, I hope when the pk flag
changes come in people will be more apt to, you know, actually fight and
thus test the system out. Of course that might just be my own pipe dream.

Blah Blah Blah, and all that,
-Aristox

-New char stats up (http://mud.arctic.org/stats/)
    (NOTE: It said previously that one person had learned prism. This was
     incorrect. One of the immortals was unvieled to level 30 when I ran
     the stat analyzer and they were counted into the spell counts. This
     has been fixed.)

THE EGG HUNT RULES

-- There will be no player-killing during the egg hunt. No stealing or
anything that is even remotely questionable. If you aren't sure, don't do
it. The wrath of the bunny is a fearsome one.

-- Eggs may be redeemed for prizes at any time, but you may only redeem
eggs once. This means that you do not have to wait until the end of the egg

Rent Decay:

    Objects decaying in rent had a few problems up until now. One of the
more noticable problems was some of the items decaying immediately upon
entering the game regardless of how long you had been out of game. These
problems are all fixed now.

-Items that are flagged RENT_DECAY will now decay only on an internal
schedule when the player is in rent. Entering the game will never force a
decay on a RENT_DECAY item, it will have been decayed sometime prior to the
login.

Groups and XP splitting:

    The forumla for groups gaining xp has been adjusted to make grouping
more favorable to xping. This will apply to any sized group, but groups of
2 to 6 will see the largest gains. This ONLY applies to players level 26 or
lower, at level 27 the splitting goes back to normal.

An example:

Group has 1 level 20, 1 level 25 and 1 level 27. Mob is worth 1000 xp.
Old System -> Level 20 gets 333xp, Level 25 gets 417xp and Level 27 gets
450 xp.
New System -> Level 20 gets 667xp, Level 25 gets 883xp and Level 27 still
gets 450xp.

    Those numbers and all the new calculations are done before the
adjustments for alignment. kill_counts and level max, so your indvidual
mileage may vary.

    The numbers may appear a bit high, so I am going to be watching things
and possibly making other adjustments as we go forward.

    The intent of this change is to make grouping at lower levels more
attractive and possibly get veteran players to bring newbies along with
them during xp sessions. Solo xp is still going to be higher on a per-mob
basis, but in theory the speed at which a group can kill should offset that
difference.

Flame on.

      Some new zones have been added to our humble game, while some old
   ones have been removed. We'll leave what these zones are to speculation
   for a couple of weeks.

    We have begun the item changes discussed on the forum
(http://mud.arctic.org/node/1748). This will be a somewhat long process and
should be done rather randomly. We are going about it slow and
systematically, so one day an item will decay like it always has and the
next it will start decaying in rent. We are going mostly item by item, not
really zone by zone, so don't expect a method to our madness. Consider this
your only warning, if an item suddenly decays on you, well thats just the
breaks.

-Gully Dwarves are now a playable race, albeit with lower stats than you
may want. They are allowed to be thieves, warriors and barbarians.
-Qualinesti can now be paladins.

Stat Rolling Changes:

Please read HELP STAT ROLLING for an overview of how the system now works.

    In basic terms, the top end stats possible have been lowered (no more
100 pt characters) and the ability to pick your primary stat during
character creation has been added. The lowering of top end stats is part of
move to slightly weaken players. The drop was not significant, but it is
noticable.

    If you pick a primary stat, your potential total for stats is capped
lower than it is if you do not pick a primary stat.

    Play with the system, let me know what you think. The ability to select
your primary stat wont be available until after the 6pm reboot today.

First step PK Flag changes:

    With this latest reboot pk flags will now be awarded for aggressive
actions, not just killing. The aggro flags are shorter duration than the

 [return for more, q to stop]killing flags. Example below:

If Denmar attacks Hekler and Hekler recalls. Hekler will be allowed to
attack Denmar in peace for 10 ticks.
If Denmar attacks Hekler and kills Hekler. Hekler will be allowed to attack
Denmar in peace for 48 ticks.

Also, case and clairvoyance will always flag you aggressive to your target.

      Hi everyone, in the past decade a massive lengthening of the
   distance between towns has been the norm. With current playerbase size
   maxing at around 100, we have decided to shrink these distances so as
   to make travel less of a burden on players. This general restructuring
   will be a long process that will be starting in the next week.
   Eventually, we hope that you notice it takes less vs to get to where
   you want to go. For the time being, though, just be sure that you stop
   using speedwalks as the roads may change at any time.

-The spell prismatic spray is now more obviously obtainable. It was decided
its previous hiding spot was too difficult when no one found it in almost a
year. So I have moved it and made the clues more overt. Happy Hunting.

May 23rd, 2006

Scouts:
-Lag removed from aim.
-Average damage raised on shoot, maxium damage should stay the same.
-Headbutt extra affect is now stopped if the target is flagged MINDSHIELD.
-Headbutt extra affect now lasts rounds in or out of combat, not rounds in
combat and ticks out of combat.
-Headbutt extra affect slightly harder to land.
-Roar now has a save on each target.
-IMMUNE_FEAR now stops you from being affected by roar.

Clans:
-Promote, Demote and Remove can now work on offline clan members.
-Ctell and Otell permformance reworked. They should be a lot faster now.
-A clan-broadcast will go out when a clan member logs in or logs out.
-The clan chieftain now shows in the clan describe and clanlist symbol
commands.
-The # of online members, # of total members and max size of the clan now
shows in the clanlist, clanlist symbol and clan describe command for clan
members.
-Clan who and clan who all reformatted to be a littler prettier (you can
all quit your bitching now).

Thieves:
-Unbalance now has an easier time adding a STUMBLE CHANCE to standing
targets.
NOTE: Stumble Chance makes bashing sitting targets easier. Unbalancing can
make bashing a sitting target easier than it was before bash was changed to
make sitting bashes harder. I suggest you use it instead of continuing to
complain about how hard landing a sitting bash is right now.

    Please keep in mind that we are in an experimentation phase, so these
changes are mostly a test set. If they work fine they will stay, but I
could change them at anytime. Also, some of the clan changes might do some
wierd things, including crash the game. If you find a crash bug please
report it immediately.

Thanks

******** NOTE *********
    There was a bug such that the game was not taking enough coins from the
person creating the clan. So if you created a clan I have taken the
difference from you. The differences were Small Clan: 5k, Medium Clan: 35k,
Large Clan: 80k. Any complaints can be sent to me (aristox@mud.arctic.org).


This is a long news item and most important piece of it is at the end, so
please read it all.

Clans:
The first phase of the clan system is now activated. You can read a little
more about it in the help files (HELP CLANS, HELP CLAN, HELP CLANLIST, HELP
CTELL, HELP OTELL).

The basic system is there are 4 tiers of players in a clan:
-The Chieftain is the leader. They control the clan in all ways. There can
only be 1 chieftain at a time.
-Elders are the officers of the clan. They can invite new players, remove
players, promote and demote players and talk on the officer chat (otell)
with each other and the chieftain, as well as use ctell to talk to the
whole clan.

 [return for more, q to stop]-Clansman are the meat of the clan. They can only talk on clan chat
(ctell).
-Neophytes are new members. They can talk on clan chat.

The person that forms the clan (using CLAN CREATE) will be made the
Chieftain automatically. Clans have a size associated with them, defined
when the clan is created. Small clans can have 20 characters in them,
medium clans can have 40 characters and large clans can have 60 characters.
There will be a system at a later date to increase the size of a clan, at a
cost.

Clans consist of 3 pieces of data:
-The name of the clan. This is a unique piece of data and can be at most
128 characters long.
-The symbol of the clan. This has to be unique to the clan (but is case
senstive so Blah and BLah and BLAH are all allowed) and is the main item
displayed about the clan, it can be at most 4 characters long. Players in
the who list will appear with their clan symbol in <> before their name
(example: <Jerk> Hekler the Male Lumberjack). Also the symbol is what is
used in the clanlist command to show data on a specific clan (clanlist
<Jerk>). The symbol will also show to_room and in scans.
-The description is a free form text field used to give the world a bit of
info about who you are as a clan. This is edittable by the Chieftain only,
while in peace and resting and not pk-flagged, after the clan is made using
CLAN EDIT_DESCRIPTION.

Right now this is a very simple structure and was designed to be so. We
want to get the bugs worked out of what we have here before moving forward
and adding anything else on top of the system. There are plans for a lot of
other things, but they have to wait.

The first thing to come is a tie in between the pk flag system and the clan
system. The details of this aren't solid yet and probably wont be for a few
weeks.

If you have any questions or comments or suggestions, feel free to post
them on the web-forums, the in-game boards, the idea command or email me
(aristox@mud.arctic.org) directly.

Bandage:
-All guilds with a really low bandage skill (mages, warriors, thieves, dark
knights and paladins) had the max value of the skill raised. Your skill
display will show as you having a lower bandage skill now, but that just
means your skill has more potential than before, your ability hasn't gotten
worse.

Race Names:
-The names of a few races have been changed: High Elves are now known as
Silvanesti, Wild Elves are now known as Kagonesti.
-A new race has been made playable, Qualinesti. They currently have the
same stats as Silvanesti for the most part, there is one very minor
difference. These will change eventually, when we rework racial stats, but
possibly not until the start of next wipe.

Experimentation Phase:
With the insertion of this clan system we are now going to be starting a
phase of the game that will see a lot of changes. That being said, over the
next 6 weeks or so we are going to be doing many changes directly to the
game that we would generally save for the downtime around a player wipe.
These things will be us testing out new ideas and seeing how they work,
making sweeping equipment and zone changes, trying out a new pkill flag
system, tweaking stat rolling, etc. If you run into problems, or bugs, or
half finished things, please report them, but dont get too upset. We are
doing this to make the game better in the end and hopefully have a shorter
downtime around the wipe.

I don't normally announce pwipes way in advance, but I will give you a
guideline for it right now. In 6 weeks, from today, if we aren't in a place
that is ready for a wipe I am going to give us 2 weeks to get ready or wipe
in the state we are in. In plainer english, this wipe has at most 8 weeks
left, hopefully shorter. With that out in the open, I hope when the pk flag
changes come in people will be more apt to, you know, actually fight and
thus test the system out. Of course that might just be my own pipe dream.

Blah Blah Blah, and all that,
-Aristox

-New char stats up (http://mud.arctic.org/stats/)
    (NOTE: It said previously that one person had learned prism. This was
     incorrect. One of the immortals was unvieled to level 30 when I ran
     the stat analyzer and they were counted into the spell counts. This
     has been fixed.)
-Help stat month year is up for Nov 05 through April 06 now. (help stat march 2006)

THE EGG HUNT RULES

-- There will be no player-killing during the egg hunt. No stealing or
anything that is even remotely questionable. If you aren't sure, don't do
it. The wrath of the bunny is a fearsome one.

-- Eggs may be redeemed for prizes at any time, but you may only redeem
eggs once. This means that you do not have to wait until the end of the egg

 [return for more, q to stop]hunt to get your prizes, but that once you do get your prizes you will no
longer be allowed to participate. Redeeming prizes on multiple chars will
not be allowed. You must be at least level 10 to redeem a prize.

-- Each player may only turn in two of each type of egg. There are eight
different eggs out there and each of them will yield you a different prize.

-- Among the eggs placed into the game are a number of diamond eggs.
These eggs will not get you a prize, but instead they will secure you a
place in the tournament that is to take place after the hunt. More details
on that later.
**********************************************************************
If you find a diamond egg, report it immediately so that we can get the
tournament set-up ahead of time.
**********************************************************************

-- The Easter Egg Hunt will END at 12AM SYSTEMTIME. At that time all eggs
must be redeemed and any eggs still in the game become worthless. The tournament
will begin at 10PM SYSTEMTME.

-- Anything that you are unclear on you should ask an immortal about
immediately, don't assume you're right because then when you're wrong,
you'll cry, and we don't want to make you cry.

-- Don't tell anyone we did this, people might think we care, and we don't.

      Icons do not have to have the word Arctic in them. In fact, on
   further inspection it might be preferable to NOT have the word Arctic
   in them. New deadline 28 Feb 2006, 12:00PM EST.
                                   Thanks,

/       =============================================
/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/             1. The icon's focus must be the word 
/               'Arctic' or 'ArcticMUD'. Submit 
/                 one with each of the words.
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be weary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/
