The death cry of a high priestess of Takhisis echoes from somewhere nearby...
The high priestess of Takhisis snarls as you deal the final blow, cackles with
an insane glee, then waves her hand and a glowing white globe appears in your
hands.
'You think my Dark Queen would let me fall so easily to mere mortals? You have
yet to see the power granted to me by her Dark Majesty, but soon you will wish
you had never set foot in this place!'
That being said, she collapses beneath her robes. As you examine the heap, you
see it is mere cloth, no sign of a corpse, not even stains of blood, then
it suddenly evaporates into a sheet of smoke, which dissapates at your
touch.
