to be some sort of contructed creature standing idly in the corner.  There

the golem.

couldn't begin to understand.  Bones in a cup on the ground, with a circle
drawn in the dirt by it, a miniature human skeleton dancing over the fire
in the middle of the room, seemingly on it's own volition, and what looks
to be some sort of contructed creature standing idly in the corner.  There
is a chest in the far corner of the hut, made out of the same material as

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
A small vial of blood red water rests here. [2]
A pair of lion skin pants lies here.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
