descend towards you on great leathery wings, howling in rage. Terror
strikes you as the near gothic creatures of hell approach you with your

  They didn't make it in time. No one came, I knew the darkness would
come again. It did, silent as shadows, they came near midnight and
darkness followed in their wake. The infernal darkness, no light would
pierce it. The noises of my men dying in that darkness, the inhuman
screams and growling. My knights rode into the horde fearlessly, never
fearing pain or death. My men, my faithful men...

The ghost begins sobbing uncontrollably.

After a few minutes go by, he composes himself and continues.

  I sent my most trusted courier for reinforcements along with my
emblem to ensure that the plea for help would be taken seriously. The
few clerics left after the first battle attempted to contact Lord Uther
via magical means to no avail, some force was preventing it. I had no
choice but to stand our ground and pray. The artifacts we recovered
raiding the dragonarmy strongholds must not fall back into enemy hands.
One night we stumbled upon a troop of black robed mages in a clearing,
they were too involved in casting their spell to notice us. The sentries
they posted also watched the spectacle, we took them out silently and
easily. The things we found there radiated evil and power, I do not know
what powers they have, but I feel it was great indeed. Shortly after that
the first attack came, we fended them off at a great cost.

The ghost's face blanches in surprise as he looks at you, 'Who are you?!
Are you the reinforcements? If so give me my emblem back, you are too
late!'

Lord Alexander says 'Wait, Thats my emblem! Praise Paladine! You have come
at last, I fear you are too late. I leave you my journal, if you truly
are from Lord Uther then you will have no problem finding my men's tomb.
Take my two most trusted men to aid you. I can rest now... so tired.'

With a blinding flash of light, Lord Alexander disappears.

The emblem decays into dust and blows away.
