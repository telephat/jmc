Incoming Changes:

-Mage spell loss on death reduced from 25% (1/4th) of spells to 16.67%
 (1/6th) of spells.
-Mage sheafs will now drop to the room when the mage dies instead of
 staying in their corpse.
-Relocation sickness on relocate/dimension door/teleport shortened
 slightly.
-Movement loss on relcoate/dimension door/teleport reduced. Should end up
 with 33% of moves instead of 10% now.
