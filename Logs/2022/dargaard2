Spell    : Primal Fury
Sphere   : Alteration
Usage    : cast 'primal fury'
Duration : A few hours or rounds
Effects  : Greatly increases combat abilities

This spell sends the caster and their groupmates into a rage, greatly
increasing combat prowess at the expense of rationale. During the fury,
the berserker will be weaker against incoming damage.

Details:
- Utility spell which increases DAMROLL and CRITICAL_SCORE, and negatively
  impacts LIMIT_DAMAGE_FACTOR

You can only inspire fury in your groupmates.

THE TRAIN COMMAND
Format: train <pet>
        train <pet> info #id
        train <pet> list
        train <pet> learn #id
        train <pet> forget #id
        train <pet> reset

You can use the train command while in the same room with a specialized pet
trainer to instruct your pet in new skills and special abilities. Using
'train <pet>' with no argument anywhere will show you your pet's current
skills and training progress. The following options are available at
pet trainers:

   info #id  : Will display extra help for a known rank specified by
               #id (the number showed next to the rank name when you
               use 'train <pet>' with no arguments).

   list      : Will display the skills normally available to your
               pet, along with the training points (T), ranks (R)
               and coins (C) they require. If your pet meets the
               requirements for a skill, it will be highlighted in
               cyan. Note that some skills have prerequisites,
               asking your pet to be trained in other skills first.

  learn #id  : Will teach your pet the skill specified by #id, as shown
               by the 'list' option.

  forget #id : Will make your pet forget the specified #id, as shown in
               your pet's current skills displayed by 'train <pet>'.
               You will not be refunded for the coins you spent to learn
               that skill. If you have bought several instances of a
               skill, only one will be forgotten.

  reset      : Will make your pet forget everything it has been taught.

Note that very few creatures can be trained, and that many powers are
restricted to certain creatures only.

help pet training
Some characters develop a very strong bond with their summoned followers,
viewing them as companions and not as mindless servants to be used and
discarded at will. As these extraordinary creatures fight along their
masters, they gain experience in the form of training points and ranks.
Specialized trainers around the world may instruct these creatures in
new skills and special abilities that will greatly enhance their prowess
and benefit their masters.

THE TRAIN COMMAND
Format: train <pet>
        train <pet> info #id
        train <pet> list
        train <pet> learn #id
        train <pet> forget #id
        train <pet> reset

You can use the train command while in the same room with a specialized pet
trainer to instruct your pet in new skills and special abilities. Using
'train <pet>' with no argument anywhere will show you your pet's current
skills and training progress. The following options are available at
pet trainers:

   info #id  : Will display extra help for a known rank specified by
               #id (the number showed next to the rank name when you
               use 'train <pet>' with no arguments).

   list      : Will display the skills normally available to your
               pet, along with the training points (T), ranks (R)
               and coins (C) they require. If your pet meets the
               requirements for a skill, it will be highlighted in
               cyan. Note that some skills have prerequisites,
               asking your pet to be trained in other skills first.

  learn #id  : Will teach your pet the skill specified by #id, as shown
               by the 'list' option.

  forget #id : Will make your pet forget the specified #id, as shown in
               your pet's current skills displayed by 'train <pet>'.

Spell    : Soul Protection
Sphere   : Necromantic
Usage    : cast 'Soul Protection'
Duration : 36 rounds
Effects  : Caster's soul is protected

When this spell is cast, the caster's soul travels from his/her body to
another plane of existence where it cannot be harmed.  This means that any
attacks or affects that would normally affect the caster's soul will not
succeed as their soul is not reachable by mortal means.

Details:
- Defensive spell with grants IMMUNE_NEGATIVE_ENERGY.
- Also interferes with atonement, restoration, and know alignment.
