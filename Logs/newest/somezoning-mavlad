fared quite well through the ages having withered slightly but still

an imposing figure, ready to decapitate anyone who might threaten the ruler
that he is duty bound to protect for eternity.

The muscular corpse of this warrior was once known as Typhus and was the
chosen champion of the Emperor. He acted as both a personal bodyguard and
close friend to the emperor, selected for the duties because of his
unwavering loyalty and unmatched combat prowess. His physical body has
fared quite well through the ages having withered slightly but still
remaining intact for the most part. A thick skirt of copper chainmail hangs
around his legs but his upper torso is free of protective armour, only
adorned by a single golden necklace marking his position as the Emperor's
champion. Clutching the handle of a hulking black battleaxe he makes quite
an imposing figure, ready to decapitate anyone who might threaten the ruler
that he is duty bound to protect for eternity.

l shaman
This nomadic shaman is not of Khurian descent, but is in fact a half-ogre.
He stands a head taller than a normal Khurian man but is still noticeably
shorter than a full blooded ogre. Strange bone charms and necklaces adorn
his body as part of his ritualistic shaman beliefs. A thick mass of shaggy
brown hair hangs from the top of his head and his hideous features are
completed with a toothless grin. Some faint tattoos sprawl up his arms
which disappear underneath his stained cloth clothing. As he stumbles
around the room performing his wierd tribal dance he leaves behind an
unpleasant smell that resembles a mixture of ogre sweat and dead animals.
Daran-Kashal the tribal shaman is in an excellent condition.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

eminate powerful raw magical energies.  Seeking to understand them
further, you begin to study the runes closely.
As you stare at the runes, you feel compelled to read on.  The magical
compulsion forces you to delve further and further into the writings.
Terrible, raw and primal magical energy fills your mind| however, just
when you feel you will lose your sanity, you realize the book presents
a method of channeling this terribly powerful energy.  The energy fades,
having been dispelled by your successful learning of the spell known
as 'cloak of bravery'.
As you finish with the book, a magical surge of energy envelops it,
and it is instantly turned to dust!

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

he spe re ma
Spell    : Read Magic
Sphere   : Divination
Usage    : cast 'read magic' [personal object]
Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Information on spells within the target is gained

An attempt is made to peer into the magical language of a spellbook,
tablet, charm or prayerbook and figure out what spell is contained within,
all without actually opening the book or putting it into any harm.

The attempt can fail for a few reasons. Most commonly this is because the
caster is not of sufficient level to understand the spells written in
the book. There are other cases where a very high level caster will still
fail.

This is a difficult process and can only be attempted once every few days.

Details:
- See above.

Component Casting:
--Decreased recast duration.

he spe ast bea
Spell    : Astral Beacon
Sphere   : Divination
Usage    : cast 'astral beacon' [char in world]
Duration : 7 + level/6 ticks
Effects  : Puts a mark on the target, allowing info to be retrieved.

If successful, the caster will put a mark on the target allowing them to
determine relatively how far away he is from the target. This beacon is of
a magical nature, and is generally not noticeable to the target after the
initial application.

Certain spells will hone in on this beacon and only work on a target which
has a beacon. The caster must be quite close to the target in order to
apply the beacon.

Spell Bonuses:
Locate Object: Will locate from your beacon and yourself.
Teleport: Works like relocate on your beacon.
Clairvoyance: Gives more information when cast on the beacon.
Astral Portal: Increased range when portaling to the beacon.
Peek: Gives more information when the beacon is peeked.

Details:
- See above.

Component Casting:
--Massively increased range.
--Target saves against spell less.

You lightly lift the frosted crystalline cover of the book.

for the proper order of a new incantation. Through your arduous effort, a
spell is revealed to you. Confidently, you scribe the spell 'astral beacon' into your
spellbook.
Having fulfilled its duty, the glass book, unexpectedly, levitates in the
middle of the room, spinning around in circles. It turns faster and faster,
until it shatters high in the air. Terrified, you duck your head, to avoid
the damage of the glass shards. After a few moments, you realize nothing

Spell    : Astral Beacon
Sphere   : Divination
Usage    : cast 'astral beacon' [char in world]
Duration : 7 + level/6 ticks
Effects  : Puts a mark on the target, allowing info to be retrieved.

If successful, the caster will put a mark on the target allowing them to
determine relatively how far away he is from the target. This beacon is of
a magical nature, and is generally not noticeable to the target after the
initial application.

has a beacon. The caster must be quite close to the target in order to
apply the beacon.

Spell Bonuses:
Locate Object: Will locate from your beacon and yourself.
Teleport: Works like relocate on your beacon.
Clairvoyance: Gives more information when cast on the beacon.
Astral Portal: Increased range when portaling to the beacon.
Peek: Gives more information when the beacon is peeked.

Details:
- See above.

Component Casting:
--Massively increased range.

Before the Northern Gates
    You are directly in front of the northern gates of Telvan, and close
enough to see numerous signs of Red Dragonarmy occupation. The gates
themselves are a rickety mess of rotting old timber, hastily constructed
ages ago and now permanently open. The old highway disappears to the north,
now abandoned, while a makeshift but well used path follows the city walls
to the west.

TELVAN
======

BACKGROUND:

The mud-baked tenements and clay businesses of Telvan have been further
distressed by the advent of the Dragonarmies. Violence in the streets and
general disrepair has further disenfranchised the poor citizens of the
bankrupt town, leading it deeper into poverty. Despite the horrors and the
negligence which runs rampant through the hamlet, the manor at the city's
center boasts luxuries worth of a Palanthian palace.

After the Dark Queen razed Jelek and conquered Neraka, most civilized
beings retreated within their homes and refuse to come out. Ogres and
draconians wearing the insignia of the dragonarmies roam the streets,
terrorizing the few stalwart residents willing to brave the decaying
streets.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The broken avenues and fierce brigands could be battled by more experienced
mid-level adventurers [20-25]. However, the secrets within the derelict
buildings would be more appropriate more experienced fighters [25+].

LOCATION:

The township of Telvan can be found south of Kalaman, but north of the city
of Neraka, not far from Gargath's Keep.

Northern Gates of Telvan
    You are just inside the northern gates of Telvan. Regah Street runs
east and west along the rickety wooden town wall, while south leads onto
Ghuth Square. What few merchants pass through these gates look nervous, and
seem to hurry as they seek lodgings within this town. Those that leave seem
happier, as if the wilderness is preferable to a night here.
A weary commoner pokes through the garbage looking for food.
