    The mine ends rather abruptly. Skeletons of humans, dwarves, and other
demihumans litter the floor. Their mining tools are either on the floor or
clenched in their fists. It appears that some disaster occurred while they
were digging that cost all of them their lives. As you silently observe,
you feel a slight draft coming from the western wall.
