THE GAZE SKILL
Format: GAZE <victim>

This power is a gift from the Dark Queen herself. To use this skill, stare
directly at your target and try to hypnotize them into doing your bidding.
In combat, this ability has the potential of paralyzing your victim.
Alternately, this ability has also been known to generate a feeling of
great fear in those gazed upon.

Given the nature of this skill, a very charismatic person has much greater
success with the art of the gaze.

Details:
- Utility skill which may inflict status effects upon a victim.
- In defensive stance, may cast fear upon the target.
- In offensive stance, may paralyze the victim.
- In balanced stance, may confuse the victim.
- If used out of combat, may charm the victim.

success with the art of the gaze.

Details:
- Utility skill which may inflict status effects upon a victim.
- In defensive stance, may cast fear upon the target.
- In offensive stance, may paralyze the victim.
- In balanced stance, may confuse the victim.
- If used out of combat, may charm the victim.

THE DRAIN SKILL
Format: DRAIN <victim>

A known ability that Takhisis may bestow upon her favored followers. This
dark gift allows the user to drain some of the target's life-force,
amplified and given to the user.  To use this skill, one must place a hand
upon the target and pull in the essence of the target. Using this ability
requires a small amount of time to recover before it can be used again.

Details:
- Offensive skill which has a variety of effects, depending on stance:
- In offensive stance, does damage to the target and provides weak healing,
  while also reducing the target's DEX while increasing the user's.
- In defensive stance, provides greater healing and weaker damage, and
  has a chance to remove harmful effects from the user.
- In balanced stance, does moderate healing and damage, and may draw
  movement points from the victim to the user.

perform actions.

- Offensive stance causes an increase to target's LIMIT_DAMAGE_FACTOR.
- Balanced stance provides a smaller amount of both of the above.

he spe blink
Spell    : Blink
Sphere   : Alteration
Usage    : cast 'blink' [direction]
Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Caster is teleported in the provided direction

This is similar to teleport, but is targetable to a direction. The caster
will instantly be transferred in the specified direction if a way can be
found through the aether. Sometimes a door can block the movement, other
times there is nothing in the direction provided. Any place that they
could not reach via teleport or relocation will more than likely not be
reachable by blink.

Even the mighty wall of force can't stop a seasoned blink-a-teer.

Details:
- Utilty spell which may allow the caster to perform a short-ranged teleport.
- This spell can teleport through some, but not all, doors.
- This spell does not allow access to rooms that are normally inaccessible
  via teleport.

Component Casting:
--Possibility to leave and arrive silently.

LARGUS SARARIAN
===============

BACKGROUND:

Little is known about the area known as Largus Sararian, caverns hidden
somewhere under the continent.  Solid in structure and clever in design,
they have remained unexplored underground for as long as anyone can
remember.  Many races claim the craftsmanship for their own, but none
have any proof to base this claim upon. The few survivors that have returned
from its depth speak of horrible creatures, malevolent demons, mighty
dragons and other monsters.  They speak of the strange, mystic power
that radiates from the very depths of the sewers and of secret passageways
that  lead to great rewards, but also great danger as they spiral down
further and further to different levels of the unknown.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Foul beasts and creatures would surely devour all but the sturdiest of
groups [20+].

LOCATION:

Rumours speak of secret gateways and caverns far below a ruined Seeker's
Temple, accessible by travelling the mountain pass from Haven to Solace.
