    A pair of oak doors, about twelve feet in height, are set into
the white washed stone walls of the mansion. To the east and west low
tan brick walls run to the north enclosing the grassy courtyard.
Against the brick walls are rows upon rows of bright red and white
roses and small herb gardens fenced off from the rest of the flowers.
In the center of the courtyard are many long hedgerows and ferns with
a pair of shady apple trees.

    This is the central living area of the mansion and most likely
the largest room. The ceiling is thirty feet high and four
chandeliers dangle from thick iron chains casting light around the
room. A hallway to the north is bordered on both sides by staircases
leading to a mezzanine above. Another hallway leads to the west and
tall twenty foot high doors cover the east wall. Tables and chairs
are scattered about the floor, most of them centered on a huge
circular rug with different constellations woven into its surface.

Before a Pair of Doors
    A pair of oak doors, about twelve feet in height, are set into
the white washed stone walls of the mansion. To the east and west low
tan brick walls run to the north enclosing the grassy courtyard.
Against the brick walls are rows upon rows of bright red and white
roses and small herb gardens fenced off from the rest of the flowers.
In the center of the courtyard are many long hedgerows and ferns with
a pair of shady apple trees.

The Great Room
    This is the central living area of the mansion and most likely
the largest room. The ceiling is thirty feet high and four
chandeliers dangle from thick iron chains casting light around the
room. A hallway to the north is bordered on both sides by staircases
leading to a mezzanine above. Another hallway leads to the west and
tall twenty foot high doors cover the east wall. Tables and chairs
are scattered about the floor, most of them centered on a huge
circular rug with different constellations woven into its surface.

The Guest Wing
    The hall is a bit narrow for being in such a huge mansion, wide
enough for two people to pass comfortably. Illumination is provided
by two chandeliers at either end of the hall. The walls are plain
stone blocks as is the floor, both exceptionally clean and taken care
of. To the west the hall opens into a small commons area and narrows
slightly as it passes a flight of stairs leading downward. To the
east the hall empties into a large room full of tables and chairs.

A simple mattress stuffed with hay sitting on a wooden frame is in the far
corner of the room next to the windows on the eastern wall. The only other

A simple mattress stuffed with hay sitting on a wooden frame is in the far

piece of furniture is a small desk in the middle of the room on a
reddish-brown rug. A single painting on the west wall is the only

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
