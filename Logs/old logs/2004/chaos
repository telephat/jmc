    We will be having a Chaos Day (okay, okay, Chaos 19 hours) this
Thursday, February 12th. Sorry for the short notification, but it couldn't
be avoided. I will be on vacation all of next week and there is a fairly
large project going on in the arctic code that needs to be finished when I
get back, so right away is about the only time to do one.

    For those of you that dont know what chaos day is, please read HELP
CHAOS DAY. For any questions please talk to an immortal or email me
(aristox@mud.arctic.org).

Thanks,
Aristox

Beware the Ides of March

    On Monday, March 15th, 2004 at 11:59pm system time ArcticMud will be
performing a complete wipe of the player and rentfiles (pwipe) associated
with the game. This means that every player will be deleted from the game.
The game will be down most of the week after the pwipe for maintenance and
general touchups. We will return on Friday, March 19th and 12:00am system
time. At that point all players will be allowed back in and can restart
playing from the beginning

    The only reason for player wipes is code or system related, we do not
clear out the playerbase on a whim. The reason behind this player wipe is a
server move. We will still be housed in the same location, but we have
gained access to a new (and much better) box to run the game on. Normally
we could just copy the player and renttfiles over to the new machine and be
fine, but we are changing server architectures as well and the file formats
are incompatible.

    This comes at an odd time for the game. We are in the middle of a major
move on the data side of things to get away from the file formats that are
currently requiring us to move. If we could have waited another month or
two we might not have had to wipe, but we decided it was in the best
interest of the game to do this now instead of later.

    The changes visible to the players during this wipe are going to be
basically non-existant. All of the stuff we have coming up is dependant on

 [return for more, q to stop]qYour blood freezes as you hear someone's death cry.
