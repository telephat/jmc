    Before you stands a Celestial Gate, a gateway of incredible energy and
power. Its frame is an intriguing mix of granite and crystal, reaching
from the floor to a few centimeters below the ceiling. Within that frame
swirls the pure energy of the day and the impure energy of the night. They
seem to dance around each other, never really touching but forever
intertwined with each other.

A helpless dargonesti prisoner slowly lifts her head and looks up at her
liberators as the thick bronze chains fall to the floor with a thud. She
coughs up some blood and smiles weakly:

        'Thank you for liberating me. That evil creature has has tortured
    me relentlessly for days now. Even now, I can still feel the lingering
    chill of his cold touch on my skin.'

A helpless dargonesti prisoner tries to move, and she turns weakly to one
side to cough up some more blood. As she does, you see that much of the
blue skin from her back has been completely shredded, exposing the muscle
and bone underneath. Blood gushes liberally from her wounds. She turns
back to you, wiping the blood away from her lips.

        'I'm afraid that even now, there is nothing you can do to save me.
    Fate has decided that I die here, but I am glad that the last sight I
    see is your face. You have my deepest th...'

Her voice trails off as the last of her blood drains out of her body. Her
eyes glaze over, and she sags back against the bloody table.

A wounded Kalaman gateguard looks up at his rescuers as the thick bronze
chains fall to the floor with a thud. He slowly lifts his head.

        'Oh, thank you, thank you so very much for my freedom. It has been
    nearly a year now, and mother must be worried sick about me. At first,
    I thought they would just kill me right away, but then they kept on
    beating me and cutting me. It was terrible!'

A wounded Kalaman gateguard sobs quietly to himself for a moment.

        'Well, it's a good thing mother gave me a way to get home, even
    if she did yank out my tooth to hide it somewhere. It really hurt when
    she did that! Thank you again for saving me.'

A wounded Kalaman gateguard gingerly reaches into his own mouth, then lets
out an effeminate scream as he slowly and painfully pulls out one of his
molars. He squeals in horror at the sight of his own blood and drops the
bloody tooth. Abruptly, he blinks out of sight, and you are left wondering
how someone like him ever became a gateguard.

    The wooden walkway ends here to the north, the loose wall of earth and
stone obstructing any advance. However, on the creaky wooden floor of the
walkway, are seven plain wooden chests resting in a row against the western
wall. Behind the chests, a piece of parchment is tacked on the western wall
of stone. The air in here is dry and a bit too crisp for most people's
liking, but at least it isn't stuffy. The wooden walkway leads back to the
south.

 Find three keys you must, for the three gifts you'll take,
 But choose carefully which, for your life is at stake.
 No monster lies on the right side of wealth.
 While the middle and an end chest are bad for your health.
 The key you desire lies next to an end,
 And so does the soul of a possible friend.

An Ebony Step
    A raised platform crafted of an ebony colored marble supports you from
underneath. The smooth, well-polished surface of the floor reflects your
lights as your tread over it. No ceilings or walls inhibit your movement,
and the pristine and unscuffed platform continues for a distance off to the
south. Past the edge of the ebony step takes one towards an ivory square
beneath the level of the one you currently occupy. In the other cardinal
directions, the nothingness of a void threatens to swallow you whole.
Hanging above the northern tip of the step, from seemingly out of nowhere,
is a wooden ladder leading up.

    Looking around in this room is very disorienting. The walls are
comprised solely of mirrors, some properly aligned at right angles, while
others are askew making the room appear much larger than it really is. It
is difficult to discern where an opening from the room can be found. At the
very least you can see a ladder leading down in the middle of the
reflections, and just above the ladder is a familiar parchment.

    This hall's walls are also constructed by mirrors of all sorts, but
these mirrors are distinctly different. In the hall below, the mirrors were
placed at all angles, but at least were uniform pieces of glass. The
mirrors in this hall, however are anything but. The mirrors distort your
reflection into a hideous image, in addition to obnoxiously bouncing the
light into every corner of the hall.

Just in arm's reach above your head is a distinctly larger mirror than the
rest in the hall. It looks like the hall might continue to the north and to

Another Mirrored Hall
    This hall's walls are also constructed by mirrors of all sorts, but
these mirrors are distinctly different. In the hall below, the mirrors were
placed at all angles, but at least were uniform pieces of glass. The
mirrors in this hall, however are anything but. The mirrors distort your
reflection into a hideous image, in addition to obnoxiously bouncing the
light into every corner of the hall.

A Cluttered Laboratory
    Within the confines of the small stone building is a very messy and
disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or
at least a kender) lived here, as various knick-knacks and half-finished
inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall. No one seems to be
occupying the lab at the moment.

    This hallway is wide and accomodating enough for several people to
stroll down unhindered. The walls are solid stone, a bit cold and damp to
the touch. You shiver, the chill of the hall permeating your body. The
hallway is nearly perfectly rectangular. The carving job was exquisite, and
most likely was done with magical means. The hall stops abruptly to the
west, but a small walk off to the east you can slightly make out a door.

pickaxes. A warm air blows softly through the hall.

disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or

inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall. No one seems to be

    This tent, as you can tell on entry, is for an officer rather than just
a grunt. It is slightly more lavish than you would expect for any normal
soldier, and the fact that the bedding accomodations are for only one
person rather than several. A crude map of the area and field pinned
against one of the tent walls, to aid in planning. The only exit you can

This draconian is certainly a bit more trained and intelligent than most
others you have seen. He has been put in charge of this small camp's
operations, but as to his plans, you have no idea. His equipment is
slightly better maintained and of better quality of his troops, but not by
much. He seems quite aware of his surroundings, and your intrusion has
prompted him to dispatch you quickly.

    Within the confines of the small stone building is a very messy and
disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or
at least a kender) lived here, as various knick-knacks and half-finished
inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall. No one seems to be
occupying the lab at the moment.
