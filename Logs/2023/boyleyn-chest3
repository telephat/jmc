 Find three keys you must, for the three gifts you'll take,
 But choose carefully which, for your life is at stake.
 At an extreme lies part of a friend who you'll join,
 While danger always rests right of the coin.
 The middle chest's lock should always remain.
 But open its neighbor, and passage you'll gain.
