TEMPLE OF GRAK
==============
 
BACKGROUND:
 
The Woods of Morgoth were at one time a place of legendary beauty in the
Plains of Solamnia. Recently, however, people have begun to disappear within
its once friendly confines.
 
It is feared that the evil cult of the god of decay and disease, Morgion has
once more inhabited an ancient temple hidden somewhere within the woods.
The woods themselves can be found just outside the west gate of the northern
city of Kalaman, deep in the Plains of Solamnia.
 
RECOMMENDED LEVELS:
 
Adventurers of lower mid-levels [6-10] in groups should be able to fully
explore the depths of the temples, and brave the undead horrors within.
 
LOCATION:
 
The woods are located to the west of the city of Kalaman, in the vast
Solamnic Plains.

LYTBURG
=======

BACKGROUND:

The citizens of Lytburg have long been under siege by a dark and sinister
power beyond their comparatively meager capabilities. Desperately they've
been enlisting the aid of adventurers far and wide, often times throwing
caution to the wind. As such, their town has surely been infiltrated by
their aggressors and is in dire need of brave defenders to rally to their
cause. Lord Frederick, castellan of Lytburg has issued messengers to come
to his aid, but his cause is grim.

While the town itself is far from the reinforcements it so desperately
needs, it has been tempered and molded into a fierce military compound.
The weakest soldiers and townsfolk have either been weeded out by the
conscription policies of the town or the attrition factor of the war.
Although one might think to prey upon the already taxed resources of
Lytburg, the remaining garrison is battle-scarred and their military
leadership quite proficient. Those willing to enlist in Lytburg's defense
should be well compensated, should the threat be lifted.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Due to the constant threat of invasion and the town's paranoia, only high
level players [25+] should attempt to engage in Lytburg's struggle. The
city's garrison is well provisioned against saboteurs.

LOCATION:

Lytburg can be found near the Plains of Solamnia, and serves as an outpost
between Garnet and the High Clerist's Tower.

FOREST OF BOKU
==============

BACKGROUND:

The mystical forest of Boku has been left in peace for centuries. Little is
known of the people and creatures who inhabit the area. In ancient times,
the forest was a healthy, thriving ecology supporting many different types
of wildlife and even a human settlement. The forest is most famous for its
extraordinarily large trees, rumored to be the largest on the face of
Krynn.

Recently, however, travelers through the forest have returned speaking of
horrible creatures and foul spirits in it. Of the travelers that survived
the trek back, most died of an evil disease within days. The ones that
lived say they witnessed undead humans wandering the forest and huge
vultures flying around. Reports of kobold scouts in the forest are as yet
unconfirmed.

The cause of the disease is unknown, but survivors who spoke with the
villagers say that the recent arrival of a powerful wizard known only as
'Mzor' and his crystal castle coincide with the onset of the strange
affliction. The villagers hope to find both a cure for the disease that is
ravaging their people, and a way to restore the forest to its former glory.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Those who have entered the forest and survived have spoken of extremely
large vultures whose evil and wickedness are unmatched. Kobold forces have
been spotted in the area, but their lair of operations has remained
undiscovered. Considering this, only a well-rounded group of experienced
adventurers [15-20] should attempt to tackle the forest. Solo
travels through the forest are no longer advisable, as the forest has
apparently gained a life of its own, containing many traps and secrets.
Adventurers would need to be much higher level to plunder everything in the
village.

LOCATION:

The forest is normally not visible to the average adventurer. It is
bordered by a large cliff, keeping it hidden from view. The cliff is
located near Throtyl Gap, and one may possibly climb the cliff to gain
entrance to the forest from there.
