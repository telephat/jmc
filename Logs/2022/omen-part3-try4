op jar
You reach towards a red clay jar, expecting something magical to happen.

As your fingers touch the clay jar's lid, you feel a malevolent presence
from within the jar reaching towards you. The spirit of a hideous spectral
guardian bound within you shivers with fear.

Suddenly, the lid bursts open, and a strange metallic mist erupts from
the jar, quickly wrapping itself around you. As you watch in horror, the
clay jar begins to grow rapidly (though perhaps it is YOU who begins to
shrink rapidly) until it is massive enough to swallow an elephant!

The metallic mist around you slowly solidifies, transforming itself into
a shimmering, reflective sphere, and the last thing you see before the
sphere's surface becomes completely opaque is the open end of the massive
clay jar turning towards you and floating forth to swallow you!

As you touch the surface of the undulating sphere, the strange liquid
metal suddenly evaporates into a silver mist and vanishes. Waves of
psycho-kinetic energy wash over you, and you cover your eyes in an
attempt to protect them from harm.
The shadows surrounding you disperse.

When you regain your senses, you find yourself floating among strange,
psychedelic lights that seem oddly familiar.

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

say Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel
You utter the words, 'Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel'

As you recite the ancient rune words, the tiny jewels on the polished
bone staff begin to glow. First, the emeralds flash to life, followed
by the rubies and then the topazes. Finally, a bright blue ray of
light bursts forth from the the large sapphire and strikes the small
Bokor Queen full in the chest.

As the light strikes her, the nimbus surrounding the Bokor Queen dims
slightly, and she suddenly lurches forward and breaks free of the
invisible forces binding her!

A grotesque spectral creature gasps in pain as it swings through the shadows surrounding you.
You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!

You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen tangles your feet with her weapon.
Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen pulls her weapon back, and you tumble on the ground!
Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen whips YOU very hard.
You wish your wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!
Yek'Thoh the Bokor Queen annihilates YOU with her whip.
You're dead.
A ring of spectral shadows releases its grip on your finger.
You feel your soul has returned.
You are no longer resistant to gas.
You are no longer resistant to breath.
You are no longer resistant to magic.
Your spirits diminish in power, but remain.
The protective presence around you fades.
Your heart stops beating so fast.
The shadows surrounding you disperse.
Your shroud fades away.
Your eyes burn for a moment and then feel normal again.
The glow of your skin slowly fades.
The blessing of the ancients subsides.
You feel less threatening.
