were digging that cost all of them their lives. As you silently observe,
you feel a slight draft coming from the western wall.

iron doors block the prisoners from escaping. The door to the north is
however slightly ajar. The eastern direction leads back to the rest of the
prison cells. On the western wall a small patch of decay has crumbled away
a small hole. There is a strong damp and musty smell in this prison.

As you free Teran from his confinements, he rises and pauses then offers
you a word of thanks. He pauses slightly then retrieves a small object from
within a hidden fold in his clothes. He whispers to you "return this object
to me when I have returned home and a just reward will be given. I am
saddened that I have nothing to offer you now. To enter my homeland go
north from Kalaman. The ocean will be difficult to navigate, but hopefully
Paladine will guide your path."
"There is one more thing I must tell you. Another of our brethren was
captured by the dragonarmies, but the officers here feared him and sent
him away to a stronghold of the dragonarmies on the eastern coast of
Southern Ergoth. Do what you can to help him, I beg of you."
With that being said he places a small object into your hand, then slowly
shapechanges into a draconian and walks from the room.

If you choose to reincarnate your character, you will be set back to level 1.

You will retain your name, gender, guild and alignment, but can choose a new
race, including exotic races. The new race must satisfy all normal restrictions
of your guild and alignment.

Mages will retain their robe color, and will not need to retake the Test of
High Sorcery. Scouts, Paladins and Dark Knights will retain their path.

You will retain all your money, equipment and pets. You will gain 2 rank
points but all your ranks will reset and you will need to buy them again.
You will retain all the non-legendary spells and instincts of your base class,
but you will be able to use them only when they become available to your new
level. Your skills will reset, but training them will be easier. Your
legendary status and all bonuses associated with it will be removed.

Your ability scores will reroll, but during character creation you will be
given 2 points to spend on any one stat. You will get a permanent bonus to
your hit and movement points, depending on your guild.

You will be able to reincarnate multiple times, but each reincarnate imposes
a cumulative penalty to the experience you gain, making it harder to level.

such names will very likely be deleted. In the event you are asked to change
