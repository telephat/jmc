    Well we had another hard crash last night, but this one does not seem
to be related to the hardware or software on the system. The current theory
is that the power was tripped in someway and caused the machine to go down
hard and fast.

    The result was 88 playerfiles being corrupted and thus deleted. I
debated trying to restore these files, but I think that is a waste of time
for everyone and our best bet is to do a full restore from backup.

    So tonight at 1am system time (July 26th, 01:00) we will have a full
restore from yesterday's backup (July 24th 05:00).

    Yes, I know this means everyone loses 2 days of playtime and yes I
agree it sucks, but this is a real big mess and I think a little bit of
chaos for the rest of today should help clear your anger.

    So for the rest of the day (basicaly the next 12 hours) we will have
a chaos day. Dont expect buffs or gear or anything, this will just be a
straight up chaos day.

Flipping through the pages and entirely focused on your studies, you nearly
overlook a bright kindling in the writing. Tiny embers begin to snap off of
the parchment as the pages become alight. You close the book in hopes that
the fire will be smothered, but it does not, as you witness the pages' edge
flare and wither. With no hope of saving the spellbook, you concede to
failure.
Licks of fire spout forth from the book, soon engulfing it. You drop the book
to the floor and can only look on as the flame reduces it to nothing.

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a cloud and a small owl chiseled above the
door. There appears to be a small lever built into the south wall.

angelic in nature, the look of anger and resentment on her face is
anything but angelic. Her skin is fair and pure, her eyes sparkling blue,

of the witches' circle, constantly looking at her sisters and then out
at the swamp around them. There is little doubt she would rather be
anywhere but the Illyoc Swamp.

the strong sense of druidic magic that swirls and dances around her.

occasionally looks to her sisters, not caring that one wishes to be
elsewhere and the other is obsessed with the swamp. She is happiest
being angry, and the swamp is the perfect place for it.
