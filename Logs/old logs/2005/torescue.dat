This huge water-faring boat looks strangely out of place for some reason.
It's got wheels you see, and it's stuck in the mud here, miles from any
ocean. Two leather sails are furled up along the length of its body, quite
strange as most sails go UP instead of to the sides.  A large painted sign
on the side of it labels the ship as the 'Cloudmaster'.  A large ball made
of lightweight material is strapped above the ship, it looks as if its filled
with air and lifting the boat slightly.
