You take a deep breath and dive at the watery barrier.
An Ornate Hallway
    The hallway through the southern section of the temple is lined with an
assortment of very ornate decorations, though they are displayed in a most
grisly fashion. The severed arms of many different races are affixed to the
eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.
The spirit of a sahuagin acolyte is hovering here.
You sense a life form.

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.
A small glass vial with a clear yellowish liquid inside sits in the dust.
A fiery red jewel sparkles in the light.
A key made out of a blue shell lies here.
An elaborately carved wooden staff lies here.

The Chamber of Sekolah
    The water filling this secret chamber is tinted red from the blood of
countless sacrifices. The chamber is bare except for a large bowl filled
with shark teeth and set on a pedestal in the middle of the room. The teeth
seem to move of their own volition despite the stillness of the surrounding
water. A hidden place such as this must be used for only the most important
sacrifices in communion with Sekolah, or for the gruesome rites of passage
his high priestesses must endure to prove their loyalty to him.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.
The corpse of a sahuagin acolyte is lying here.
A heavy bronze crossbow lies here.
A bronze spear lies here.
The spirit of a fallen sahuagin warrior floats here.
The spirit of a senior sahuagin battle priestess is hovering here.
The spirit of a Knight of the Lily is hovering here.
You sense a life form.

You climb atop the huge statue and jump up through the watery barrier.
You frantically paddle at the water, hoping to keep from falling back down.

You are relieved to find yourself able to stay afloat.
A Strange Coral Tunnel
    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Settlement
    At the intersection of the wide coral tunnels lays the center of the
sahuagin settlement. This chamber is quite large, tantamount to the great
square of Kalaman, only underwater. A large statue of an striking shark
stands at the center of the chamber, its vicious jaws open wide and ready
to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement
extends in all directions except for north, where the coral tunnels ends
abruptly at an underwater cliff.
The spirit of a fallen sahuagin warrior floats here.

Atop an Underwater Cliff
    Away from the sahuagin settlement, this cliff extends from a large hole
in the otherwise solid coral formations to the south. Based on the damaged
coral and jagged claw marks around of the hole, it appears the sahuagin were
planning to extend the settlement this way, but didn't realize the coral
reefs didn't continue this direction. The cliff top is surrounded by murky
darkness and feels quite lonesome. Strangely, the darkness appears to wave
rhythmically back and forth with the moving waters.

Above a Forest of Kelp
    Surrounded by a myriad of stalky plants the area quickly becomes dark
and murky. The leaves of kelp, held together by a thick, strong central
stalk rise up towards the surface above. Little pockets of air upon the
leaves and stalk, no more than half the size of a steel coin, keep the
plant upright and allow it to wave to and fro. Medium-sized fish, too big
for the coral reef yet too small to defend themselves in the open ocean
have found a suitable home here among the kelp. They dart and weave around
the plants effortlessly, always enjoying a suitable hiding spot.

kelp makes it easy to lose one's way within this underwater forest. The
kelp stalks root to the sea floor and spread out as they reach towards
the surface. Each stalk waves in unison with the others in a rhythmic,
almost hypnotic manner. One could easily pass right by something in the
expansive kelp forest and never notice.

Against a Massive Stone Cliff
    The path through the forest of kelp comes to an end next to a massive
stone cliff. The cliff rises out of the sandy sea floor and stretches up
towards the surface, its true size masked by the waving stalks of kelp
nearby. All manner of mindless sea creatures cling to the cliff's stone
surface, absorbing nutrients out of the moving water. To the north and
east, thick stalks of kelp sway gently back and forth. The path through
the kelp forest continues back to the south.

An Undersea Cavern
    Thick walls of solid stone surround this undersea cavern. Sheltered
from the tumultuous whims of the ocean, the water here is calm and clear,
though occasionally a stray current will surge through and stir the algae
around. Barely visible through the murky darkness, a dense forest of kelp
lies beyond the mouth of the cavern. The underwater cavern is very deep,
and the bottom is lost in darkness below.

Lost in a Forest of Kelp
    The darkness of the water combined with the countless stalks of wavy
kelp makes it easy to lose one's way within this underwater forest. The
kelp stalks root to the sea floor and spread out as they reach towards
the surface. Each stalk waves in unison with the others in a rhythmic,
almost hypnotic manner. One could easily pass right by something in the
expansive kelp forest and never notice.

Against a Massive Stone Cliff
    The path through the forest of kelp comes to an end next to a massive
stone cliff. The cliff rises out of the sandy sea floor and stretches up
towards the surface, its true size masked by the waving stalks of kelp
nearby. All manner of mindless sea creatures cling to the cliff's stone
surface, absorbing nutrients out of the moving water. To the north and
east, thick stalks of kelp sway gently back and forth. The path through
the kelp forest continues back to the south.

An Undersea Cavern
    Thick walls of solid stone surround this undersea cavern. Sheltered
from the tumultuous whims of the ocean, the water here is calm and clear,
though occasionally a stray current will surge through and stir the algae
around. Barely visible through the murky darkness, a dense forest of kelp
lies beyond the mouth of the cavern. The underwater cavern is very deep,
and the bottom is lost in darkness below.

An Undersea Cavern
    Deep in the undersea cavern, the stone walls are both solid and thick.
Though the water is mostly clear, an occasional current will kick up some
sediment. A large, heavy boulder rests against the northern stone wall,
standing guard over a pile of strange skeletons next to it. The skeletons
don't appear to be very old, and yet it seems some sort of vicious fish
must have picked all the flesh from the bones. There is a palpable sense
of anticipation and danger in this dark place.

Summoning all of your courage, you pray for luck and swim towards the dark
crevice, kicking up a cloud of sediments behind you.

As you make your way through the crevice, you find yourself feeling along
blindly through pitch darkness. You panic as you realize the dark passage
is getting narrower and your gear starts to snag on a few protrusions of
stone each time you are forced to squeeze through.

Distracted by your struggles, you suddenly realize that you have passed
through the tightest parts of the passage as the stone surfaces begin to
pull away from you and the salty water starts to feel less oppressive.

You emerge to find yourself at the bottom of an underwater canyon.

A Dark Underwater Lair
    Hidden under the soft sediment floor of an underwater canyon, this dark
lair is shrouded in shadow. The outer edges of the cavern are lost in total
darkness, though the lair is clearly enormous. A dark, inky substance hangs
suspended in the water, though its source is unclear. Streams of sediment
fall slowly from above, floating around the cavern in lazy circles on its
way down. The only apparent way to escape the lair lies through the opening
in the ceiling that the sediment is falling through.

A Tidy Coralsmith's Shop
    This large coral hut is tidily kept. Tall stacks of coral plates and
neat piles of coral blades rest in a dark corner while a wide worktable
dominates the room. An assortment of strange tools rest on a bench next
to the worktable, ready to be used by the coralsmith who runs this shop.
A variety of coral weapons and armor are displayed around the hut, either
hanging from long hooks in the ceiling or resting in wide racks along the
wall. Hiding among the more mundane coral weapons, there are a few rather
exotic weapons which look extremely deadly.

A Tidy Coralsmith's Shop
    This large coral hut is tidily kept. Tall stacks of coral plates and
neat piles of coral blades rest in a dark corner while a wide worktable
dominates the room. An assortment of strange tools rest on a bench next
to the worktable, ready to be used by the coralsmith who runs this shop.
A variety of coral weapons and armor are displayed around the hut, either
hanging from long hooks in the ceiling or resting in wide racks along the
wall. Hiding among the more mundane coral weapons, there are a few rather
exotic weapons which look extremely deadly.

Water Way Central
    The central section of Water Way is lined with shops which are a mere
short swim off the path. The primary shops belong to a hide worker and a
coralsmith, but far in the distance, the classic Darthallan coral huts can

Way, which splits into Water Way East and Water Way West. Southwards, the

The Origin of the Tail
    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft

Beneath a Floating Cone of Stone
    A small cone of stone floats overhead, unmoving. The cone doesn't sink,
and yet it doesn't float away either, despite not being tethered to the sea
floor. Beneath the cone, the water shimmers behind the illusionary slope of
what was supposed to be an underwater hill. Although there are no walls in
any direction, large shrubs of fan coral block progress in all directions
except back to the east. The water here is surprisingly still, despite the
currents beyond the illusion that cause the fan coral shrubs to sway. A few
small display cases are scattered around the area.

the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the

The 'Y' of Water Way
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

floor have been lined up in rows facing the north end of the temple. Small
fish duck through holes and between large strands of seaweed at the sides
of the temple. To the east a small corridor can be seen through the coral,
and to the north an altar is easily seen. A calming serenity hangs in the

Before the Temple of Abbuku
    To the north stands a splendid temple constructed from living white
coral. The white coral walls are flecked with specks of blue, marking it
as the Temple of Abbuku. South of here, Water Way leads away from the

Water Way East
    The eastern tail fin of Water Way is made of a soft and mushy brown
silt. It is lined with small coral houses, which must be the homes of the
dargonesti who inhabit this underwater city. Growing next to the path are
a variety of kelps and sea plants in an array of greens, reds, and pinks.
To the west the path ends at the 'Y' of Water Way, while the path to the
north leads to an enormous building of living white coral.

The 'Y' of Water Way
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

Water Way West
    The western tail fin of Water Way leads right to the entrance of the
renowned coral gardens of Darthalla. Expert dargonesti gardeners have
spent centuries studying nature and its processes to learn to cultivate
the miniature coral reefs and rare sea plants growing within the verdant
gardens. To the east lies the 'Y' of Water Way. The path to the gardens
is lined with brown, yellow, and green kelp.

Entering the Coral Gardens
    Skinny strands of kelp rise from the soft silt of the floor here. The
kelp creates a beautiful mix of greens, browns, and yellows. A beautiful
lavender archway to the south signals where Water Way ends and the coral
gardens begin. There are a few trampled reefs in this area, but the truly
magnificent specimens are found throughout the gardens beyond. Dargonesti
families and young couples from the city both seem to enjoy coming to the
gardens to pass time, as many groups of sea elves wander by.

A Turquoise Coral Reef
    Amidst the skinny strands of kelp rising from the ocean floor are large
mounds of beautiful turquoise coral. Each mound is connected to the others
near it, creating a small ecosystem of aquamarine in this section of the
gardens. Fish, anemones, and hermit crabs have all adopted the colors of
the reef to blend in among the safety of the coral. A few large yellow fish
add a stark contrast with the bright turquoise color that predominates the
area. The reefs end at a cliff's edge at the north end of the gardens.

A Simple Coral Hut
    This elegant, if simple, coral hut is the home of the elderly ranger
who watches over the coral gardens. Judging by the lack of decor the old
ranger must be a no-nonsense sort of fellow. Other than a thin bedroll,

A Tidy Coralsmith's Shop
    This large coral hut is tidily kept. Tall stacks of coral plates and
neat piles of coral blades rest in a dark corner while a wide worktable
dominates the room. An assortment of strange tools rest on a bench next
to the worktable, ready to be used by the coralsmith who runs this shop.
A variety of coral weapons and armor are displayed around the hut, either
hanging from long hooks in the ceiling or resting in wide racks along the
wall. Hiding among the more mundane coral weapons, there are a few rather
exotic weapons which look extremely deadly.

The Origin of the Tail
    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

The Entrance to the Tower of the Moon
    The doorway to the Tower of the Moon lies directly to the south. The
tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

A Large Coral Antechamber
    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
You sense a life form.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.
A large multicolored portal hovers near one wall of the room...it glows dimly
You sense a life form.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
You sense a life form.
The clan alchemist is standing here.
