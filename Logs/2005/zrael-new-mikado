lApproaching the Farm
    Farther from the main road, the trees trunks seem to disappear back
over the horizion to the north. There are no signs that anyone has been
here in quite a while. Off to the north, the path runs back into the main
roadway, while off to the south, the farmlands strech as far as the eye can
see. A large house lies to the southwest, while a barn and fields lie to
the southeast.

276H 94V 13387329X 2021C Mem:2 Exits:NS> sNearing a Split in the Path
    A small fence once blocked the path here, but now it is falling to
pieces. Time has done it's work, transforming the fence from a beautiful
sight, to a husk of it's former self. The boards are in shambles, chunks of
wood missing, the red paint worn, several planks have even rotted away. The
hinges, old and rusty, refuse to budge, preventing any use of the gate.
Through the fence, the path continues southward, into a fork. Off towards
the southeast lies a large field, and to the southwest, a house, falling
apart under the wear of time.

276H 92V 13387329X 2021C Mem:2 Exits:NS> sA Choice of Paths
    The main path ends, spliting into two smaller paths, one to the east,
and another to the west. The path to the east appears to lead to a large
field, with a barn in the distance. The path towards the house is overgrown
with weeds, and looks as if noone has done anything to maintain it for
years. The sky appears darker towards the house, giving a sense of the evil
that lies within.

    The cobblestones of the walkway are covered by weeds of all sizes. The
cobblestone path is roughly five feet wide, and continues to the west
towards a small house. Off in the distance, to the east, there is a large
field with a barn. The cobblestones in the path appear to have been here
for many years, discolored by years of traffic, and the ever obvious lack
of maintenance.

276H 88V 13387329X 2021C Mem:2 Exits:EW> wNearing a Farmhouse
    The cobblestones that lined the path have all but disappeared. The lack
of any maintenance has resulted in vegitation taking over the area, and all
but destroying the walkway. Large rocks are scattered about, imbedded in
the ground, almost as if they were dropped from the sky. The thick moss
covering the rocks is the only real indication to how long it's been since
someone was here. The farmhouse in the distance is close now, revealing
that it's in as bad of repair as the rest of the area.

276H 86V 13387329X 2021C Mem:2 Exits:EW> wThe Front Porch
   The front porch of the house is quite small. It is lined with a small
railing, that fallen apart due to lack of repairs. The paint is pealing from
the house in several places, revealing the rotten wood behind. Judging from the
size, paint, color, and design, it is obvious that this house was once a
beautiful place but is not one any longer. The house shows no signs of life,
but there are signs of recent movement.

    Upon entering the doorway, it is obvious that this entryway has not
been used to greet guests in years. A coat rack is lying on the floor,
broken into several pieces. Along the walls, burn marks indicate where
pictures used to hang. The walls are charred by flames, and burned to a
dark black. Some wallpaper hangs from the wall, making it look like someone
was trying to cover the burn marks. It is obvious that they didn't get a
chance to finish.

stench from the garbage still can be smelled. There are several more piles
of garbage laying before the stairs, and a old lantern hangs overhead, but
the light no longer shines. It, along with everything else around here
seems to have been broken a long time ago.

able to hold the weight of even one person. The railing has been smashed to
pieces, splinters laying all around. The wall is covered with some wood
panels, in an attempt to keep the weather out. The panels to the west are
severly charred, but a panel to the east appears brand new. Upon further
inspection, a second set of support beams has been placed under the stairs,
making them quite sturdy.

'My name is Zrael, I was once master of this farm. My family and I lived
here for years in peace, until a witch cusred me and my farm.

'Everything started going crazy, the animals were in a state of perpetual
decay, the crops wouldn't grow, the rain wouldn't fall. I have tried many
things to try and break the curse, but as of yet, I have been
unsuccessful.

'I recently tried bringing a demon into the world to force it to help me,
but it broke the hold I had on it. It captured me and my children, and
started summoning more people to help it.

'I would have used magic to break myself out of here long ago, but that
rune in the wall prevents magic from working here. The only way to escape
will be to recover the key to the shackles they are using to hold me. The
demon witch keeps the key with her at all times.

'Would you please go take it from her and help me escape?

    This is a small and cozy kitchen. Pots and pans hang from a rack on the
roof, while a cook stove is sitting in the corner. Old wood boards make up
the floor, and it creaks when stepped on. Cabinets line the walls, and the
smell of rotten food is overpowering. A dim light shines in from the porch
to the south, while the smell of rotten food is stronger to the east.

been used to greet guests in years. A coat rack is lying on the floor,
broken into several pieces. Along the walls, burn marks indicate where

dark black. Some wallpaper hangs from the wall, making it look like someone
was trying to cover the burn marks. It is obvious that they didn't get a

   The front porch of the house is quite small. It is lined with a small
railing, that fallen apart due to lack of repairs. The paint is pealing from
the house in several places, revealing the rotten wood behind. Judging from the
size, paint, color, and design, it is obvious that this house was once a
beautiful place but is not one any longer. The house shows no signs of life,
but there are signs of recent movement.

    The cobblestones that lined the path have all but disappeared. The lack
of any maintenance has resulted in vegitation taking over the area, and all
but destroying the walkway. Large rocks are scattered about, imbedded in
the ground, almost as if they were dropped from the sky. The thick moss
covering the rocks is the only real indication to how long it's been since
someone was here. The farmhouse in the distance is close now, revealing
that it's in as bad of repair as the rest of the area.

    The cobblestones of the walkway are covered by weeds of all sizes. The
cobblestone path is roughly five feet wide, and continues to the west
towards a small house. Off in the distance, to the east, there is a large
field with a barn. The cobblestones in the path appear to have been here
for many years, discolored by years of traffic, and the ever obvious lack
of maintenance.

and another to the west. The path to the east appears to lead to a large
field, with a barn in the distance. The path towards the house is overgrown
with weeds, and looks as if noone has done anything to maintain it for
years. The sky appears darker towards the house, giving a sense of the evil
