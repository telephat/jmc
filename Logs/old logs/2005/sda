Sphere   : Illusion
Usage    : cast 'improved invisibility'
Duration : (level / 5 ) hours/combat rounds
Effects  : Makes caster invisible

When cast, the caster will fade from view and become invisible, reducing their
armor class significantly.  This effect lasts for a limited duration, and
unlike its predecessor, invisibility, improved invisibility does not wear off
when the victim engages in combat.  The spell lasts until the end of its
duration or until dispelled.

Usage    : cast 'improved invisibility'
Duration : (level / 5 ) hours/combat rounds
Effects  : Makes caster invisible

When cast, the caster will fade from view and become invisible, reducing their
armor class significantly.  This effect lasts for a limited duration, and
unlike its predecessor, invisibility, improved invisibility does not wear off
when the victim engages in combat.  The spell lasts until the end of its
duration or until dispelled.

Usage    : cast 'invisibility' [char/object in room]
Duration : 1 day on people / permanent on objects
Effects  : Makes things invisible

When cast on a living thing, the victim will fade from view and become 
invisible, reducing their armor class significantly.  This effect is 
temporary, lasting 1 day or until the victim engages in combat.  Attacking
one's self will remove this spell also.

When cast on an object, the item becomes invisible permanently. In order to
use it therefore, you must be affected by the 'detect invisible' spell. The
invisible enchantment may be removed by using the 'dispel magic' spell.
