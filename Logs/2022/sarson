Rickety Staircase
     The staircase descends deeper into the basement.  You can see the top
of the stairs above you while only blackness appears to await you further
down in the depths. You can see many ancient scars upon the walls from what
appear to be either claws or acid.  There is a strange smell upon the
stairs wafting up from below.

Base of the Stairs
     You stand at the base of the stairs at the entrance to a large
hollowed out cavern.  The cavern leads off to the west from here.  It
slopes slightly down as it moves in that direction.  You can hear dripping
water falling from the cavern roof.

Musty Cavern
     The musty cavern has widened at this point.  The dripping water has
formed into many small residual pools.  Strange glow from the mosses in
this particular cavern have given a small amount of light to the room.  You
can either move towards an old looking stairway to the east or follow the
cavern as it tapers to a long thin crack to the south.

the hall lies a large inlaid silver gate founded in sturdy red brick
mortar.  You can feel a faint trace of heat from the direction of the gate.

leads off into the darkness beyond. You can see small pools of hot water
forming where water has dripped from the cavern top above. The expansive
hall seems to radiate an almost abnormal heat.

book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging

The Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A long and comfortable sofa stretches the length of the room.

of old blood lingers in the air, mixing with the scents of leather and
unsavory herbs to create a feeling of nausea in the pit of your stomach.
Some drawstring pouches are draped from the wolf hide walls. In the center of
the hut is a ring of jet black stones, with some sealed ceramic jars dotting
the ground around it. A small altar, littered with rocks and charms sits on
the rear wall.
