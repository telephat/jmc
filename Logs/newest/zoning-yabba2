help affinity
Affinity measures the enchantment potential of an item. Generally speaking,
more powerful sigils can only be inscribed on items with high affinity.

Some items have a natural, fixed amount of affinity. Such items can only 
be inscribed with a single sigil at a time, providing a permanent effect. 
Extremely powerful ATTUNED items can increase their affinity by strengthening
the bond with their owner when they perform certain quests.
