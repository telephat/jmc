     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.
There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

body is smaller than his brethren, and his muscles less developed, though

wrapped around a shining sword.
