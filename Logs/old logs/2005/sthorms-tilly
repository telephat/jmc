Hiya! I'm Tironki Burrfoot, thanks for helping me out of that trap! Wow,
those skull knights are so uptight! All I did was find their pile of gold
for them, you'd think they'd thank me! I guess they don't like kender here,
I guess thats alright because I don't like this place. Ooohhh, I almost
forgot, I heard the high priestess talking about some traitor they were
gonna strap to the altar after me...What was her name? Sally? Kara? Sara!
Thats it! Well thanks for helping me out!

pouches and start after him when you notice Steel's stoic face go pale.

I am Sir Garrin, Knight of the...Crown. I was captured in Northern Ergoth as
on my way home...You must warn the world! The Knights of Takhisis are
growing...I am useless, my time here is nearing end...Please, warn the world
or soon the Dark Knights will conquer all...Please...

He starts coughing again, more violently now...blood flowing rapidly from his
mouth. Somehow, with his dying breath he manages to utters the words, 'Est
Sularus Oth Mithas', then his eyes close and a look of peace washes over
face.

Steel chortles loudly and says:
You expect me to feel compassion for my enemy? That man would've sooner seen me
dead than rescue me if the situations were reversed. Nothing has changed, my
loyalty still lies with Lord Ariakan. I hear they have captured a traitor...
perhaps you would like to free him too.

Koharo approaches the altar and presses the one of the stone buttons down
firmly. You hear a click, followed by a low hum, and slowly the kender sits
up on the altar. He rubs his little shoulders and smiles at Koharo and
says:
Hiya! I'm Tironki Burrfoot, thanks for helping me out of that trap! Wow,
those skull knights are so uptight! All I did was find their pile of gold
for them, you'd think they'd thank me! I guess they don't like kender here,
I guess thats alright because I don't like this place. Ooohhh, I almost
forgot, I heard the high priestess talking about some traitor they were
gonna strap to the altar after me...What was her name? Sally? Kara? Sara!
Thats it! Well thanks for helping me out!

With a smile and a hug Tironki scampers south, you instinctively check your
pouches and start after him when you notice Steel's stoic face go pale.

'The traitor...It's mother...We have to save her!'
