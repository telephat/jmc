Sphere   : Enchantment
Usage    : cast 'charm monster' [opponent/char in room]
Duration : Variable
Effects  : Make a monster your servant

This spell will make the victim much more attentive to your needs! The
victim will instantly consider you their best friend and will do almost
anything to help. Consequently, the caster can order the victim to do any
task (except kill themselves| even charmed victims have self-preservation
instincts). Due to the concentration involved, you may order one particular
servant at once. You will only be able to charm victims that are of lower
level than you| and the victim's level is further restricted to be lower
than a number between 11 and 16 depending on your own level.

order <victim> <action>
Example: 
>Order orc say My master is the best!

The higher the intelligence of the victim, the shorter the duration of
enchantment.
