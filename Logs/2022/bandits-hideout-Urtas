Deep Into The Forest
     The forest continues to expand in all directions. The trees grow tall
and strong here, giving shelter to the many forest creatures that inhabit
these woods. Eastward thorny bushes and thick ferns block travel more
effectively than a stone wall would, while to the north the trees and
bushes seem to form an almost impassable barrier.

You squeeze between the trees, trying to fit into the narrow opening.
Between The Trees
     You manage to wriggle among the thorny bushes and trees. Their wiry
branches seem to tug at you, tearing your clothes and pricking your skin to
the point of drawing blood. The narrow passage continues northward while to
the south you can go back into the open forest though a small opening
between the trees.

A Narrow Passage
     The bushes clear somewhat, and you can now walk among them without
getting scratched. The trees continue to grow tall here but to the north
they seem to end in a large clearing in the middle of the forest.

Before A Camp
     The trees suddenly end here, forming a large clearing to the north.
The soft, pleasant sounds of the wild forest give way to the harsher sounds
of civilization. You stand before what seems to be a small camp made of
old, brown tents set up in an ordered fashion. The tents are covered with
tree branches| it looks like someone took care to hide this place from
curious eyes. A narrow passage among thorny bushes leads southward, toward
a dense forest.

A Path Through The Camp
     You stand within the camp's perimeter. You notice that the tents are
made from thick, worn canvas and appear quite old. The ground, once covered
by grass, has now been trod to filthy mud. The camp expands to the north,
while to the south a small path leads towards the forest.

A Path Through The Camp
     The path continues to the north. You find yourself standing on the gap
between two of the brown canvas tents that fill the camp. The dirt below
you seems recently and heavily walked on. To the north you can make out
some sort of crossroads, probably the center of the camp. To the south you
can still see the forest and safety.
A bandit guard is patrolling the camp.

The ropes constricting the goblin are too tight to untie, so you draw your
weapon to cut them off. The goblin shudders as it watches you walking
towards him. It relaxes only when it sees you cut its bonds, and, as soon
as you remove the rug that gags it, it begins speaking quickly:

'Me Sainis. Master Toede had news, other highlord in area, strong one. He
sent me to watch and learn, if other highlord threat to great Toede. Came,
but too many humans!'

The goblin waves both its hands, the fingers open...

'Four! Too many! I find hidden camp, humans try to confuse me in forest,
they make sounds like owls in deep wood! But me smart, no owls in day
right? So I find hidden camp but four humans capture me! Thank you for
freeing me, Master Toede will learn about you!'

With these words, the goblin darts outside and is quickly lost from view.

Inside A Makeshift Forge
     You stand inside a makeshift forge. A small stone furnace has been
built here, and a heavy anvil is resting on the ground nearby. The furnace
has been constructed from carefully cut stones and mortar, and is filled
with red-hot coals. The high temperature here makes you sweat and long for
the cold air outside. Various tools, carefully wrapped in oilskin rags and
hidden under a small tent for protection from the elements, are placed on a
shelf next to the furnace.

Inside A Tent
     The tent is fairly clean and large. Six cots, made from fresh wood and
covered with pieces of clean cloth, make up its furniture. The ground is
relatively clean, while a small fire pit has been dug in the center of the
tent. You notice that directly above it a small hole has been cut to allow
the smoke to escape outside. Flaps on the northern side of the tent lead
outside, into the camp.

Between The Tents
     You stand at an intersection in the camp. The muck you are walking on
can hardly be qualified as ground. To the north the camp expands, while
westward it stops before the forest trees. Directly to the west of here,
you can enter a brown tent. A large pile of boxes is nearly obscuring the
entrance of a second tent to the south.

Inside A Tent
     The scent of unwashed human bodies nearly overpowers you as you enter
the cramped tent. This tent is filthy and looks abandoned. Its floor is
littered with unfinished meals and half-empty jugs of foul smelling whisky.
Four cots made of leaves and torn, dirty rags are placed in the corners of
the tent. The fresh air of the clearing beckons you to the east.

Between The Tents
     You are walking among the tents of the camp. The ground has been
trodden to a muddy mess composed of burnt wood, food bits, broken jugs and
other, even less savoury, components. To the north a tent wall blocks your
vision, while the camp continues to the east. Moving west will take you to
the center of the camp. To the south you can enter one of the cramped
canvas tents.

In The Middle Of The Camp
     You have reached the middle of the camp. Someone has dug a well here|
it is filled with clear, cold water. You are surrounded by old, worn tents.
Whoever lives here doesn't seem to mind much about hygiene as the camp is
filled with the debris of cooking fires and broken jugs of rotgut whiskey.
A large tent, taller than the rest, stands to the north.

A Path Through The Camp
     The path continues to the north. You find yourself standing on the gap
between two of the brown canvas tents that fill the camp. The dirt below
you seems recently and heavily walked on. To the north you can make out
some sort of crossroads, probably the center of the camp. To the south you
can still see the forest and safety.

A Path Through The Camp
     You stand within the camp's perimeter. You notice that the tents are
made from thick, worn canvas and appear quite old. The ground, once covered
by grass, has now been trod to filthy mud. The camp expands to the north,
while to the south a small path leads towards the forest.

Before A Camp
     The trees suddenly end here, forming a large clearing to the north.
The soft, pleasant sounds of the wild forest give way to the harsher sounds
of civilization. You stand before what seems to be a small camp made of
old, brown tents set up in an ordered fashion. The tents are covered with
tree branches| it looks like someone took care to hide this place from
curious eyes. A narrow passage among thorny bushes leads southward, toward
a dense forest.

A Narrow Passage
     The bushes clear somewhat, and you can now walk among them without
getting scratched. The trees continue to grow tall here but to the north
they seem to end in a large clearing in the middle of the forest.

Between The Trees
     You manage to wriggle among the thorny bushes and trees. Their wiry
branches seem to tug at you, tearing your clothes and pricking your skin to
the point of drawing blood. The narrow passage continues northward while to
the south you can go back into the open forest though a small opening
between the trees.

Deep Into The Forest
     The forest continues to expand in all directions. The trees grow tall
and strong here, giving shelter to the many forest creatures that inhabit
these woods. Eastward thorny bushes and thick ferns block travel more
effectively than a stone wall would, while to the north the trees and
bushes seem to form an almost impassable barrier.
