Brith'Nea steps away from the battle, and thrusts her arms skyward. Flames
spew lazily from her eyes like hellfire madness. Her lips move slightly at
first, then more rapid. Archaic words filled with hatred slip from her
mouth at an increasingly higher volume, reaching a crescendo. The chanting
nears a scream as the air crackles with electricity, bolts of power arc off
Brith'nea striking the ground at your feet. Suddenly a rift appears in
midair over the valley floor, dark violet, blue, and red colors swirl
enchantingly, then two figures emerge from the great tear. Fiery demons
descend towards you on great leathery wings, howling in rage. Terror
strikes you as the near gothic creatures of hell approach you with your
souls in their hate filled eyes of fire.
