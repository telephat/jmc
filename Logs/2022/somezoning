A Bend in the Path
    The huge trees are all around, seemingly moving in closer. Many of
their thick branches shoot out over the path you are on in a menacing
manner, as if they might drop down and snatch you up any minute. It is
quieter in this part of the forest and the gigantic birds don't seem to be
as plentiful here. The canopy far above keeps it near dark down here, even
during the daylight hours. The path you are on bends from the north around
to the east, since the foliage south and west are entirely too thick to
forge a path through.

enough to travel through. The vultures fly around overhead, silent as ever.
