The Northern Gate of Solace
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

A Narrow Road
    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

A Narrow Road
    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The

At the Edge of Nearfields
    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

Along the Shore of Crystalmir
    You are at the corner of a large lake, which fills your vision far to
the west before ending at high, jagged cliffs. The forest of pine that this
trail winds through thins out to the north and east, where large fields of
grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

Elven Arch
    A breeze, carrying the scent of wildflowers, washes gently over you,
and departs with the quietest of whispers. Overhead, the white clouds mold
and twist themselves, splashing against the shores of heavens unseen. The
azure sky, peeking carefully between frothy, white lumps, begins to show
the first signs of night as darkness begins to pull itself across the
horizon. Retreating, the sun offers the land its warmth, beams of gold
slicing through the cool air. Ahead, the forest begins to pull together,
trees crowding against each other, and vines twisting about the
moss-covered trunks, creating a wall of vegetation. Strangely, it seems
that some of the forest has become interlaced into a poetic arch, crossing
the space just above you. Through this arch, the trail continues to the

Northern Path
    The forest presses inward, pushing and shoving at the small, dirty
trail. Ancient trees line the path, reaching out and digging their hard
roots, like tentacles, into the muddy forest floor. The uneasy roar of
silence overwhelms the sweet chirpings of a Thrush, and pushes its way
through the forest undergrowth, rushing over your feet like tiny waves.

    Vines like great serpents hang precariously from the lower branches of
the trees. Coiling and squeezing, the thin, green ropes have woven
themselves into a natural tapestry. A thick, chaotic knot, this forest
curtain separates the civilized from the wild. Brushing aside the numerous
strands, trying to peer into the forest's inner depths, one can only see
the shifting of shadows as the angle of natural light is altered.

    A fine mist, tiny droplets of rainwater, shuffle to the earth, and run
down the trunks of the trees in tiny rivulets. Placing your hand upon the
wet bark, you can feel warmth spewing out of the wood and into your

A Clearing
    Suddenly opening up, the path cuts across a large area cleared of any
major, and natural, obstacles. Rising from the green grass, erupting in a
shower of stone, a large cliff curls about this clearing. Against the
cliff, a waterfall showers down onto the rocks, and disappears underneath
the fertile land, flowing to realms unknown. Bubbling incessantly, the
crystalline liquid rests momentarily amongst a small patch of reeds hugging
the base of the cliff. In the middle of the clearing, a circular patch of
dead grass has been cleared by intelligent hands, the center being coated
with soot and half-burnt logs. Obviously, this clearing has served as a
camping ground for travellers.

Rocky Trail
    The mud and dirt have now given away to a thick covering of white
gravel. Alongside the trail, small clusters of green grass flap in the wind
like tiny battle flags, and clumps of snow lie melting in the sun. The air,
once warm, has become dry and cool, your breath shooting out in plumes of
hot steam. Branches droop dangerously over the path, the leaves covered in
a thin layer of frozen dew, and icicles, as sharp as daggers, hang from the
wood, sparkling in the light.

Forest Center
    A mighty oak tree dominates the center of the path. Spreading its
ice-covered branches upwards toward the sky, the long, gnarled fingers hang
over the surrounding area as a mother protecting her children. Scarred and
colored a fading brown, the trunk has become firmly embedded in the forest
floor over the last several hundred years. Walking past it, stiff blades of
frozen grass crumble and shatter beneath your feet, the freezing
temperatures beginning to numb your toes. In the distance, the sobs of a
crying female can be heard. Past these sounds, to the north, the path
allows you to move closer to the mountains.

Mountain View
    Stabbing the clear skies, the peaks of the mountains stretch upwards to
the heavens. A ring of clouds encircles the very pinnacle, hugging the cold
rock and protecting the great sheets of ice and snow that blanket the solid
cliffs. Within the clouds, strange shapes flit and soar about, breaking
away from the froth, and, then, meld and mold themselves into contorted
shapes, eventually merging back into their snow-filled homes and
disappearing from sight.

Sacred Passage
    The trees, the foliage, sparkle in the light, covered in a thin layer
of frost. Seemingly painted on, the frozen dew attaches itself to the oak
trees, swirling patterns turning the hard wood into a natural canvas.
Across the ground, just outside the trail, tiny footprints have been left
behind, and lead in a variety of directions, twisting through the woods. At
your feet, thin ruts are the only signs of passing carts, and they become
deeper as the path continues to the north. Oddly, the wheel tracks only
begin at this point, and, even though the earth has been frozen by the
mountain's frigid winds, the imprints are deeply cut into the black soil.
To the west, hidden behind a tree leaning to one side, its roots being
slowly, tortuously ripped from the forest floor, a pile of brush lies

River of The Dead
    The waters of this once mighty mountain river no longer flow clear and
cool. Over the years, under the hot and torrid sun, this stream has slowly
become tainted, poisons seeping into its humid, brown depths. Some distance
ahead, in the mist and fog of the peaks, rising before the northward path
like the gods of elements, a waterfall can be seen tripping down the sides,
the slopes, of the snow-covered mountains. Most unlike the incessant
murmuring of this fall, the River of The Dead snaps harshly against the

River of The Dead
    Great chunks of ice and snow collapse into the swampy waters, sliding
down a small slope to the north and finally rolling into the river. Here,
the current has increased in strength, and scummy water pulls the boat
gently toward the south. In that direction, just inside a thick line of
trees hanging over the tepid water, great pillars of precious metals rise
from the forest floor and climb great heights. From within, floating
outward, the music of a flute can be heard hovering above the river. Before
you, the muddy water of the River of The Dead rushes about in frenzied
confusion. Twirling about, a great whirlpool has been created near the
southern bank, sucking in the forest debris scattered on the dull and oily
surface of this mountain stream.

weeds, the trees bow over the narrow passage and let their fruit-ladened

blooms seeking to disguise it, cover it. Behind you, the river wallows in
its prison, running aground and, then, pulling back in fear. Rising over

A Turn Along the Ridge
    A tall, rocky overhang juts from the southern slope, casting a shadow
over the trail. The steep rock formation is caked with green moss, and its
steep, smooth surface makes it impossible to scale. Tall boulders lay
against the rocky overhang and block any movement in the eastern direction.
The forest opens up to the west, a magnificant spectacle of majestic trees,
light green foliage, and bustling wildlife. The only clear passage down the
ridge is a narrow chute through the trees to the north.

The Outskirts of a Dense Forest
    Descending into the depths of the forest, it is obvious that this path
has not been used in quite a long time. Almost overgrown with choking
weeds, the trees bow over the narrow passage and let their fruit-ladened
branches droop overhead, threatening to break and fall to the ground. A
musky smell creeps toward the river from the west, the sweet scent of
blooms seeking to disguise it, cover it. Behind you, the river wallows in
its prison, running aground and, then, pulling back in fear. Rising over
the noise of the waters, the sound of grunting can be heard, somewhere,
deep within the trees.

A Turn Along the Ridge
    A tall, rocky overhang juts from the southern slope, casting a shadow
over the trail. The steep rock formation is caked with green moss, and its
steep, smooth surface makes it impossible to scale. Tall boulders lay
against the rocky overhang and block any movement in the eastern direction.
The forest opens up to the west, a magnificant spectacle of majestic trees,
light green foliage, and bustling wildlife. The only clear passage down the
ridge is a narrow chute through the trees to the north.

The Outskirts of a Lush Forest
    The forest floor is carpeted in lush, knee-high wild grass. Large moss-
covered boulders blend with the tall grass and green foliage of the forest
trees, creating a myriad of shadows across the forest floor. The terrain
slopes downward to the west, and a small path has been beaten into the
ground to safely navigate the steep terrain. Only tiny portions of the sky
may be observed through the thick canopy of leaves overhead. A small path
extends westward along the ridge line into more dense forest growth.

Skirting the Forest Perimeter
    Tall Oaks pepper this small section of the forest, making it nearly
impossible to walk more than ten paces in a straight line. The ground is
littered with broken sticks and leaves, creating loud crackling snaps with
each step. Bird chatter in this area is loud and energetic, and the
branches and leaves rustle violently from the activity. Several large
bird nests are barely visible in the dense tree foliage. A maze of trees
opens to the north, and a small hill filters down into a beautiful basin to
the west.

    The large basin floor is more spacious than the surrounding woods. A
small dried creek bed runs through the area, wide and deep enough to make
the crossing a bit more cautious, yet manageable. Tall, green wild grass
covers much of the basin floor, with several tall bushes and thistle
interspersed. The skeleton of a large animal lies near the edge of the
dried creek bed, its carcass long cleaned so that nothing edible remains.

appears to thrive near the water's edge, where many small and large shapes
can be seen moving. A small, chipped arrowhead lies near the base of a tall

    A thriving, verdant forest lay between two tall, gray ridges. A small
trail marks the entrance to a quaint, elven village seemingly hidden in a
stunning, wooded valley. Massive oak trees dominate the rolling forest
terrain, providing a shaded canopy over the pristine forest. The calls of
exotic birds echo off the magnificent oaks and towering cliffs on both
sides of the valley. Thick, green foliage provides a stunning contrast to
the dark, fertile forest soil. The rich, black earth produces colorful,
vibrant specimens of flowers, bushes, and ivy, all teeming with insect
life. The dim outline of small, round huts are almost perfectly camouflaged
by the dense, green vegetation. A narrow pass leads west through tall grass

An Intersection of Paths
    Several paths meet on a rocky section of exposed bedrock, slightly
elevated above the surrounding foliage. Tiny, bright red spider mites, only
the size of a small grain of salt, crawl across the rocky, uneven surface.
Long, twisted thick vines hang from branches spanning the trail just out of
arms reach. The musical sound of bird life is nearly deafening above, where
hundreds of black birds have gathered and create quite a commotion. Two
long lines of well organized huts begin to the south and disappear in the
haze of the thick forest air. A small path heading due east runs directly
to the the centerpiece of the village - the ceremonial ring. Another well
trod trail picks up to the north snaking through more domed dwellings and
tall trees. Tall, thin shapes duck in and out of nearby huts, and the sound
of elven tongue is barely audible over the intense bird activity. Two watch
stands are barely visible in the sprawling oaks to the north and south,
well hidden in large leafy oaks.

A Path Through the Village
    A narrow path has been beaten through the green forest, circling the
elven village's ceremonial ring. Tall wild grass and large green bushes
with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,
tracing the outskirts of the elven village.

A Watch Stand High in the Trees
    A wooden platform large enough to hold two elven sentries is perched
high in tall oaks. The platform is constructed from thick wooden branches
lashed together, encircling the wide oak trunk. A large basket of arrows is
fastened overhead, and several long bows and supplies rest on a shelf built
into the fork of a thick branch. The bottom of the platform is camouflaged
with leaves and branches, making the perch quite difficult to spot from the
trail below. Large gaps in the green canopy provide excellent view of the
elven village. Small stakes imbedded in the oak trunk provide means to
climb up and down the tall tree. A rope bridge leads south to another
watchstand positioned atop a sprawling oak.

    A wooden platform encircles the wide oak trunk, suspended high above
the forest floor. The platform extends several paces out from the oak
trunk, providing access to views in every direction. Small wooden spikes
imbedded in the giant oak provide means to scale up or down the brown
giant. Although hidden by leafy camouflage, the platform provides an
outstanding bird's eye view of the bustling elven village. Several female
elves carry small baskets with fresh berries along the narrow trail below.

Outside a Large Lodge High in the Trees
    A large lodge, by wild elven standards, is constructed on a wooden
platform encircling a massive oak trunk. The lodge is constructed from
carved wood braces and leather walls. The entrance and several side flaps
have been tied open to let in the crisp, clear air. Several make-shift
seats line the outside of the structure, fashioned from smaller tree
stumps. A small pile of curled wood chips lies near an unfinished figurine
next to the largest stump. A narrow suspension bridge of wood planks and
rope extend from the platform to an adjacent lodge to the west.

Inside the Village Elder's Lodge
    The leather-bound lodge is crafted in a octagonal fashion with sturdy
poles mounted to a wide platform that encircles the mighty oak. At any
single spot in the lodge, the other side is blocked by the massive oak
trunk that extends through the center of the lodges roof. A large bearskin
rug is draped near the huts entrance, baring its teeth towards the opening
like a ever vigilant watchdog. Various beaded decorations, colorful pipes,
hanging plants decorate the sloping, leather walls. The lodge's narrow
flaps are tied open, allowing a gentle breeze to flow through the dwelling,
mixing fresh air with the sweet scent of incense. A narrow suspension
bridge is partially visible through the narrow lodge entrance to the north.

A Watch Stand Overlooking the Village
    A wooden platform encircles the wide oak trunk, suspended high above
the forest floor. The platform extends several paces out from the oak
trunk, providing access to views in every direction. Small wooden spikes
imbedded in the giant oak provide means to scale up or down the brown
giant. Although hidden by leafy camouflage, the platform provides an
outstanding bird's eye view of the bustling elven village. Several female
elves carry small baskets with fresh berries along the narrow trail below.

A Watch Stand High in the Trees
    A wooden platform large enough to hold two elven sentries is perched
high in tall oaks. The platform is constructed from thick wooden branches
lashed together, encircling the wide oak trunk. A large basket of arrows is
fastened overhead, and several long bows and supplies rest on a shelf built
into the fork of a thick branch. The bottom of the platform is camouflaged
with leaves and branches, making the perch quite difficult to spot from the
trail below. Large gaps in the green canopy provide excellent view of the
elven village. Small stakes imbedded in the oak trunk provide means to
climb up and down the tall tree. A rope bridge leads south to another
watchstand positioned atop a sprawling oak.

A Path Through the Village
    A narrow path has been beaten through the green forest, circling the
elven village's ceremonial ring. Tall wild grass and large green bushes
with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,
tracing the outskirts of the elven village.

An Intersection of Paths
    Several paths meet on a rocky section of exposed bedrock, slightly
elevated above the surrounding foliage. Tiny, bright red spider mites, only
the size of a small grain of salt, crawl across the rocky, uneven surface.
Long, twisted thick vines hang from branches spanning the trail just out of
arms reach. The musical sound of bird life is nearly deafening above, where
hundreds of black birds have gathered and create quite a commotion. Two
long lines of well organized huts begin to the south and disappear in the
haze of the thick forest air. A small path heading due east runs directly
to the the centerpiece of the village - the ceremonial ring. Another well
trod trail picks up to the north snaking through more domed dwellings and
tall trees. Tall, thin shapes duck in and out of nearby huts, and the sound
of elven tongue is barely audible over the intense bird activity. Two watch
stands are barely visible in the sprawling oaks to the north and south,
well hidden in large leafy oaks.

Among the Warriors' Huts
    A wide trail snakes through tall oaks and green maples near the heart
of the elven village. Two uniform lines of larger huts form a mirror image
of each other on both sides of the trampled, busy trail. The domed
structures are closer in proximity than the small huts marking the
perimeter of the small village, indicating their importance in the elven
pecking order. Large racks of long bows and assorted weapons are stored
under the umbrage of sprawling oaks, marking this stretch of trail the home
of the village's fighting elite. Several young male sentries huddle in a
circle near a fire pit, working diligently at carving and stringing
powerful longbows. A small elven boy sits nearby mimicking the older elves
with a pained expression on his face, failing repeatedly to string his bow.
Nearby, Kagonesti women navigate the pristine forest with agility and
grace, gathering berries from thick green bushes covered with red berries.

A Path Skirting the Village
    Towering oaks and maples pepper the undulating, verdant landscape
creating a stunning, green ceiling over the thriving forest. A tall rocky
slope looms to the south, rising high above the treetops. Several young
wild elves tending to chores stop and take note of strangers entering the
village their faces are marked with unease at the disturbance. A large,
brown eagle is perched high atop an oak branch extending over the dirt
path. The powerful bird scans the forest floor, searching intently for its
next meal. Further up the same tree, a modest lodge encircles the brown
trunk, mostly obscured by thick leaf cover. A small rope bridge extends
from two sides of the lodge into nearby branches, the destination not
revealed in the green canopy. Leather huts populate the lush forest,
complimenting the natural beauty of the pristine valley. The narrow dirt

A Forest Path
    A narrow dirt path winds through the sprawling oaks, skirting a small
elven village. Tiny pebbles and twigs litter the narrow, uneven path. Low
hanging branches of smaller maple trees dangle over the path, requiring an
adventurer to duck and weave through a maze of leaves. Elaborate spider
webs float in the gentle breeze, becoming entangled on any creature that
lumbers down the well trod trail. Small, modest huts are interspersed
throughout the lush forest, blending perfectly with the softly rolling
landscape. Most of the elven dwellings are positioned under the shade of
larger trees, nestled in the soft wild grass. The smell of roasted hare
permeates the thick forest air, mixing with the sweet floral scents of the
abundant wild flowers. The sound of young elves running and giggling nearby
echoes throughout the trees. Overhead, several wooden platforms encircle
the mighty oak trunks and are connected by simple rope suspension bridges.

An Intersection of Paths
    Several paths meet on a rocky section of exposed bedrock, slightly
elevated above the surrounding foliage. Tiny, bright red spider mites, only
the size of a small grain of salt, crawl across the rocky, uneven surface.
Long, twisted thick vines hang from branches spanning the trail just out of
arms reach. The musical sound of bird life is nearly deafening above, where
hundreds of black birds have gathered and create quite a commotion. Two
long lines of well organized huts begin to the south and disappear in the
haze of the thick forest air. A small path heading due east runs directly
to the the centerpiece of the village - the ceremonial ring. Another well
trod trail picks up to the north snaking through more domed dwellings and
tall trees. Tall, thin shapes duck in and out of nearby huts, and the sound
of elven tongue is barely audible over the intense bird activity. Two watch
stands are barely visible in the sprawling oaks to the north and south,
well hidden in large leafy oaks.

A Path Through the Village
    A narrow path has been beaten through the green forest, circling the
elven village's ceremonial ring. Tall wild grass and large green bushes
with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,
tracing the outskirts of the elven village.

Before a Strange Hut
    The lush forest terrain grows denser in this small section of the
valley. Tall briar and creepers encroach upon the narrow dirt trail, almost
grabbing at the feet of those that walk too close to the trail's edge. A
large huts sits alone within a small grove in the thick vegetation. The
large hut is is more rectangular in structure and leans awkwardly to one
side, propped against the base of a tall, gnarled tree. Long strands of
green moss hang from the the tree's thick, twisting branches, draping over
the damaged thatch roof. A giant, black kettle boils nearby, emitting dark
smoke and a pungent odor. Two large poles are staked into the grass on both
sides of the hut's entrance, each with detailed carvings and colorful
feathers. Small, colorful bead strands hang from the huts open flap,
allowing a minimal view of the fur-lined interior. A smaller path breaks
from the main trail and leads south to the tribal ring, marking the center
of the elven village. The main trail continues trough the dense forest to
the east and west.

Before a Strange Hut
    The lush forest terrain grows denser in this small section of the
valley. Tall briar and creepers encroach upon the narrow dirt trail, almost
grabbing at the feet of those that walk too close to the trail's edge. A
large huts sits alone within a small grove in the thick vegetation. The
large hut is is more rectangular in structure and leans awkwardly to one
side, propped against the base of a tall, gnarled tree. Long strands of
green moss hang from the the tree's thick, twisting branches, draping over
the damaged thatch roof. A giant, black kettle boils nearby, emitting dark
smoke and a pungent odor. Two large poles are staked into the grass on both
sides of the hut's entrance, each with detailed carvings and colorful
feathers. Small, colorful bead strands hang from the huts open flap,
allowing a minimal view of the fur-lined interior. A smaller path breaks
from the main trail and leads south to the tribal ring, marking the center
of the elven village. The main trail continues trough the dense forest to
the east and west.

A Path Through the Village
    A narrow dirt path rounds the northeastern corner of the quaint elven
village. A large, black snake slithers quickly across the trail,
disappearing in a thick maze of tangled green ivy. Several small mud huts
are scattered deeper in the forest, lying in the shade of massive oak
trees. The forest terrain grows denser traveling west on the narrow dirt
path, where a large, strange hut rests under the twisted branches of a
moss-covered tree. A tall oak rises near the bend in the path, and a small
platform is barely visible through the thick green foliage. A small rope
ladder is coiled at the base of the platform, far out of reach.
Occasionally, the rustling of leaves above betray the presence of an elven
sentry watching from above. To the southwest, large white stone are stacked
neatly three feet tall and form the outer perimeter of the tribe's
ceremonial ring. In the distance, the melodic voices of elven children
giggling echo through the tranquil forest.

A Junction of Trails
    A large intersection of trampled dirt paths lies under a lush canopy of
tall maples, arching oaks, and a few scattered pine trees. Small river
pebbles are imbedded in the dirt path, compressed some time ago when the
trail was muddied after a hard rain. Small patches of tall wild grass bend
over the edges of the winding trail, peppered with exotic wild flowers. The
white painted stones of the tribal ring barely show through the dense wall
of foliage to the west. The main trail skirts the perimeter of the forest
village, winding to the north and south. Another path leads east, narrower
than the rest, through a tunnel of overhanging branches, leading to a
large, domed hut resting under a magnificent oak.

A Forest Training Ground
    Tall branched trees provide a canopy over the trampled, dirt forest
floor. The elves have meticulously cleared the brush to build a large,
circular practice area amongst the trees. A line of oaks to the east have
large circular targets strapped to their trunks. Loose straw and broken
arrows litter the ground at the base of the targets. High up in the trees
several young elves practice climbing and leaping from branch to branch,
stalking imaginary prey. Sitting on a rocky outcrop, a young warrior
watches with great interest as a young male elf hones thrust and parry
techniques against an older sparring partner. Narrow dirt trails leave the
training ground to the north and west.

A Wide Path through the Forest
    Several dirt trails meet under a tall canopy of oak trees near the
southern reaches of the valley. The main trail is well trod and littered
with dried leaves, fallen acorns, and dried twigs from the looming trees.
The well trod path runs east and west, skirting the small elven village.
Large platforms and small lodge are constructed high in the arching oaks,
partially hidden in the thick green foliage. The large, white stones
forming the outer wall of the tribal ring are barely visible through the
thick, green wall of brush directly north. A massive branch angles down,
near the intersection of paths only a few feet above arms reach. A giant
constrictor snake is wrapped around the crooked branch, its head hanging
within reach, flicking its tongue quickly. A narrow, rocky trail runs
south, leading towards a tight passage up the towering, granite ridge.

A Narrow Trail Through The Forest
    A dirt trail climbs slightly towards the south as it meanders through
the forest, tightly hedged in on both sides by dense growths of trees and
shrubs. The flora comes especially close together at one point in
particular, nearly pinching off the trail altogether. The ground near the
trail at this point looks slightly disturbed, as if some person or people
spent a great deal of time milling about or guarding the pass. Peering over
the rising ground southward reveals the face of a looming cliff, its full
height masked by treetops. Down the gentle slope to the north the Kagonesti
village is plainly visible.

A Narrow Trail Through The Forest
    A dirt trail climbs slightly towards the south as it meanders through
the forest, tightly hedged in on both sides by dense growths of trees and
shrubs. The flora comes especially close together at one point in
particular, nearly pinching off the trail altogether. The ground near the
trail at this point looks slightly disturbed, as if some person or people
spent a great deal of time milling about or guarding the pass. Peering over
the rising ground southward reveals the face of a looming cliff, its full
height masked by treetops. Down the gentle slope to the north the Kagonesti
village is plainly visible.

The Base of a Cliff
    The dirt trail leads the forest to meet the base of a cliff here,
abruptly halting the woodlands' progress southward. The trees seem little
discouraged by this however, and grow just as determined and tightly
together as they can. The path changes from dirt to loose stone and shale
as it continues where the trees cannot, traversing over several large
boulders and between wiry scrub-bushes before leading into a narrow crack
in the rock-face. From within the heart of the cliff a hidden slope is
revealed where thousands of rocks and pebbles from above have partially
filled the fracture. The trail steeply ascends the rocky slope and finally
emerges to meet the open sky above.

A Treacherous Pass
    A narrow, rugged pass runs southward, where the mountainous ridge split
apart in ages past. The rent halves loom high overhead to the east and west
and are hopelessly unscalable. Atop the western half and nearly impossible
to see from this angle, several bulky rocks are lined up together with
narrow gaps between them. Very little vegetation of any kind grows in the
rocky soil, leaving the ground vulnerable to erosion. This also makes the
ground loose and slippery, especially where it slopes and forms a gravelly
hill leading downward. In stark contrast to the harsh and bleak terrain in
all other directions, the middle boughs of the forest's emerald canopy sits
at eye-level some distance to the north. Squirrels and birds can be seen
playing, flitting and singing amongst the branches: the only happy slice of
life this place has to offer. A massive boulder leans to one side precariously,
blocking the passage north.

    The eastern wall sinks away and hollows out to form an immense cave
here. Dim rays of light and intermittent noises originate from within the
cave, but it's much too deep to see anything noteworthy from here. Farther
south on the eastern side the ridge drops off into thin air, with nothing
below except piles of loosened rocks and certain death if someone were to
lose their footing. Unlike its other half, the western wall seems to rise
only higher and the perch above is well guarded by a barricade of boulders.

Along The Ridge
    The eastern wall sinks away and hollows out to form an immense cave
here. Dim rays of light and intermittent noises originate from within the
cave, but it's much too deep to see anything noteworthy from here. Farther
south on the eastern side the ridge drops off into thin air, with nothing
below except piles of loosened rocks and certain death if someone were to
lose their footing. Unlike its other half, the western wall seems to rise
only higher and the perch above is well guarded by a barricade of boulders.
To the south a huge, rocky tooth juts nearly straight up from the ground.
If not for the slight incline and many handholds in its rough surface that
allow it to be climbed, the path would die right here.

A Mammoth Cave
    Low fires burn dimly from within dozens of metal braziers spaced
throughout the enormous cave, flooding it with a dusky, smoke-hazed
ambiance. In the center of this monstrous abode stands an expansive, round,
wooden table with enough wooden chairs to seat nearly twenty elves around
it. A fine rug sits beneath the table and stretches across a significant
portion of the cave. One of its ends reaches along the southern wall of the
cave where a few beds and many bedrolls are laid out upon the fabric,
offering a comfortable place to rest and relax. All the way across the cave
upon the rocky northern wall hangs a fancy tapestry, depicting heroic elves
alongside a shining silver dragon. Beneath the majestic tapestry sits a
small shrine dedicated to Paladine, patron god of the metallic dragons.
Deep within the lair against the back wall lays a more personal section of
the abode. Here stands a towering bookshelf, completely filled with ancient
tomes and manuals. Beside it stands another, equally tall shelf containing
the books that wouldn't fit within the other as well as many bottles, jars,
and other odd objects as well as a long wooden trunk resting upon the
bottom plank. Nearby, a man-sized wardrobe sits half-open with many
brightly-colored yet tasteful items of clothing. Away from the wall and
centered between all the furniture lies a well-crafted desk with stacks of
papers upon its surface and accompanied by a high-backed chair.
Inky darkness flows into the room, chilling your bones.
A fearsome blue dragon, Sus, is standing here, ignoring you.

A Mammoth Cave
    Low fires burn dimly from within dozens of metal braziers spaced
throughout the enormous cave, flooding it with a dusky, smoke-hazed
ambiance. In the center of this monstrous abode stands an expansive, round,
wooden table with enough wooden chairs to seat nearly twenty elves around
it. A fine rug sits beneath the table and stretches across a significant
portion of the cave. One of its ends reaches along the southern wall of the
cave where a few beds and many bedrolls are laid out upon the fabric,
offering a comfortable place to rest and relax. All the way across the cave
upon the rocky northern wall hangs a fancy tapestry, depicting heroic elves
alongside a shining silver dragon. Beneath the majestic tapestry sits a
small shrine dedicated to Paladine, patron god of the metallic dragons.
Deep within the lair against the back wall lays a more personal section of
the abode. Here stands a towering bookshelf, completely filled with ancient
tomes and manuals. Beside it stands another, equally tall shelf containing
the books that wouldn't fit within the other as well as many bottles, jars,
and other odd objects as well as a long wooden trunk resting upon the
bottom plank. Nearby, a man-sized wardrobe sits half-open with many
brightly-colored yet tasteful items of clothing. Away from the wall and
centered between all the furniture lies a well-crafted desk with stacks of
papers upon its surface and accompanied by a high-backed chair.
Inky darkness flows into the room, chilling your bones.

A Mammoth Cave
    Low fires burn dimly from within dozens of metal braziers spaced
throughout the enormous cave, flooding it with a dusky, smoke-hazed
ambiance. In the center of this monstrous abode stands an expansive, round,
wooden table with enough wooden chairs to seat nearly twenty elves around
it. A fine rug sits beneath the table and stretches across a significant
portion of the cave. One of its ends reaches along the southern wall of the
cave where a few beds and many bedrolls are laid out upon the fabric,
offering a comfortable place to rest and relax. All the way across the cave
upon the rocky northern wall hangs a fancy tapestry, depicting heroic elves
alongside a shining silver dragon. Beneath the majestic tapestry sits a
small shrine dedicated to Paladine, patron god of the metallic dragons.
Deep within the lair against the back wall lays a more personal section of
the abode. Here stands a towering bookshelf, completely filled with ancient
tomes and manuals. Beside it stands another, equally tall shelf containing
the books that wouldn't fit within the other as well as many bottles, jars,
and other odd objects as well as a long wooden trunk resting upon the
bottom plank. Nearby, a man-sized wardrobe sits half-open with many
brightly-colored yet tasteful items of clothing. Away from the wall and
centered between all the furniture lies a well-crafted desk with stacks of
papers upon its surface and accompanied by a high-backed chair.
The corpse of Kallasra, the elven warrioress is lying here.
The corpse of Shraxas, the silver dragon is lying here.

below except piles of loosened rocks and certain death if someone were to
lose their footing. Unlike its other half, the western wall seems to rise
only higher and the perch above is well guarded by a barricade of boulders.

Over The Tooth
    A gentle slope climbs southward up the ridge, bounded to the west by
the sheer face of the upper path. The base of the incline connects to the
very tip of a jagged fang of rock, which leads down to a lower ledge.
Gazing far out over the tooth one can see a narrow pass between hulking
walls of solid rock and a tiny slice of lush, green forest farther beyond.
No greenery is to be found within arm's reach though, with the exception of
a few scraggly looking shrubs struggling in the dry, rocky substrate. The
ground is firm with minimal shale but is also very unlevel and the entire
slope slants to the east before it drops off sharply, making steady footing
difficult to maintain. Empty sky looms over the edge with waving treetops
frighteningly far below, compounding the nervous atmosphere.

interspersed along the slope and down its sides. In stark contrast to these
rugged surroundings, a lush and vibrant forest canopy lies directly
southward at the base of the ridge. Although the ridge drops off initially

The Entrance to a Green Basin
    Rock and stone begin to give way to rich brown soil teaming with
scattered bushes, creeping vines and a handful of steadfast trees. The
forest is doing its best to capitalize on this chance to expand, growing
right to edge of the solid rock underfoot and slowly pushing its way to the
cliff base. Despite its best attempts, this section still grows rather
thinly and it is far from teeming with animal life. Gazing southward
reveals much denser growth as the forest truly comes alive, promising a
maze of emerald depths to come. In the opposite direction stands the
towering ridge, with a steep, spiral path leading up to its craggy heights.

Within the Sacred Forest
    Thick brown vines drape from the ancient forest canopy, criss-crossing
high above the forest floor like a mammoth spider web ominously looming
high in the thick, arching branches. The leafy canopy is dense but many
patchy openings allow a view of the heavens and a fair amount of warm,
enriching sunlight to filter down during the day. Down within their shadows
creeps the foot of the ridge, curving around from the north to the
southeast and cutting off much of the forest growth. A strange, pervasive
aura emanates from seemingly everywhere and everything, instilling a
feeling of venerable wisdom, calm and peace within all who sojourn through
this place. As the feelings of calmness and bliss deepen they leave behind
a dull and almost euphoric confusion in their wake.

Within the Sacred Forest
    Thick brown vines drape from the ancient forest canopy, criss-crossing
high above the forest floor like a mammoth spider web ominously looming
high in the thick, arching branches. The leafy canopy is dense but many
patchy openings allow a view of the heavens and a fair amount of warm,
enriching sunlight to filter down during the day. Down within their shadows
creeps the foot of the ridge, curving around from the north to the
southeast and cutting off much of the forest growth. A strange, pervasive
aura emanates from seemingly everywhere and everything, instilling a
feeling of venerable wisdom, calm and peace within all who sojourn through
this place. As the feelings of calmness and bliss deepen they leave behind
a dull and almost euphoric confusion in their wake.

The Entrance to an Elven Village
    The entrance to a small elven village is marked with lush green grass
and towering, brown vallenwoods. Small leather-bound huts pepper the
rolling terrain, shaded by the dense yellow-green foliage of the sprawling
brown giants. Several wooden platforms and lodges are nestled high in the
massive trees, and a towering vallenwood to the east has a wooden staircase
constructed around its girth to provide access to the labyrinth of
platforms and lodges gracing the high canopy. A worn path winds throughout
the village, passing between the huts, skirting the edges of more dense
foliage. The strong scent of a cookfire drifts on the light breeze,
originating somewhere among the smattering of domed huts.

The Entrance to an Elven Village
    The entrance to a small elven village is marked with lush green grass
and towering, brown vallenwoods. Small leather-bound huts pepper the
rolling terrain, shaded by the dense yellow-green foliage of the sprawling
brown giants. Several wooden platforms and lodges are nestled high in the
massive trees, and a towering vallenwood to the east has a wooden staircase
constructed around its girth to provide access to the labyrinth of
platforms and lodges gracing the high canopy. A worn path winds throughout
the village, passing between the huts, skirting the edges of more dense
foliage. The strong scent of a cookfire drifts on the light breeze,
originating somewhere among the smattering of domed huts.

massive trees, and a towering vallenwood to the east has a wooden staircase
constructed around its girth to provide access to the labyrinth of
platforms and lodges gracing the high canopy. A worn path winds throughout
the village, passing between the huts, skirting the edges of more dense
foliage. The strong scent of a cookfire drifts on the light breeze,
originating somewhere among the smattering of domed huts.

A Path Through the Elven Village
    A lightly trampled dirt path winds between the domed dwellings of the
elven village. The huts are spaced well apart and most are positioned under
the umbrage of smaller oak and weeping willow trees. Small cook fires are
positioned between the huts, where the elves tend to congregate. Massive
vallenwoods dwarf overhead, but these grand trees are spaced much further
apart. A maze of platforms and wooden lodges grace the massive boughs of
the large branches overhead. A perched watchstand is positioned in the
lower branches of the massive brown giant to the east, overlooking the huts
below.

A Path Through the Elven Village
    Dense forest borders the northern and western perimeter of this section
of the elven village. The dense forest view borders the narrow trail like a
large tapestry of rich green and brown hues. Small leather huts are
scattered throughout the verdant landscape, and the domed dwellings
compliment the lush terrain. The forest hums with energy as the sounds of
the elven village blend with the thriving wildlife that inhabits the
forest. Directly overhead a watchstand is perched in the lower branches of
a massive vallenwood that climbs hundreds of feet into the air. Wooden
platforms extend along the giant boughs creating a labyrinth of paths in
the leafy canopy where elves move about freely. A large wooden staircase is
constructed around the wide circumference of a giant vallenwood to the
south.

At the Base of a Magnificent Tree
    An enormous vallenwood graces the rolling, grassy terrain in this
section of the small village. A wooden staircase has been constructed
around the wide vallenwoods base, providing access to a maze of platforms
and lodges high in the leafy canopy. Two watchstands are visible in the
lower branches of the massive tree, one to the north, and the other to the
south. A large ring of white painted stones lies to the west, marking the
tribe's ceremonial ring. Dense foliage blankets the eastern edge of the
village making it difficult to see very far into the thriving forest. A
small trail winds through the village, and many leather bound huts are
peppered to the north and south.

massive vallenwood tree, almost a hundred feet above the forest floor. Wide
bridges stretch north and south, supported by strong, wide vallenwood
branches. Torches are positioned along both sides of the wooden bridge
creating a stunning, flickering effect high in the leafy canopy. This
perch offers a bird's eye view of the village below, where small domed huts
pepper the rolling forest terrain. Several wood and leather lodges are
constructed higher in the trees, partially obscured by the thick, leafy
foliage. Two watchstands are positioned nearby, one to the north and another
to the south to keep vigil over the elven village.

offering a bird's eye view over the heart of the elven village. A weapons
rack is fastened to the vallenwood's trunk stocked with supplies and
weapons. Several leather-bound lodges are constructed high in the trees,
connected by a labyrinth of bridges, platforms, and ladders. The platform
also permits access to bridges spanning north and east, leading to other

    A leather-bound lodge is constructed on a wide platform that encircles
the trunk of a mighty vallenwood. The large rectangular dwelling is
constructed of leather skins pulled over wooden supports. The partially
open entrance flap reveals a modest, tidy dwelling of a wild elf. Wooden
railing surrounds the platform's perimeter, and large flickering torches
add light to the area. Several small benches are positioned outside the hut
and provide a stunning perch from which to enjoy a spectacular forest view
from these dizzying heights. A rope bridge extends to the south to a nearby
platform, where another large lodge rests in the shade of dense green
foliage. A narrow staircase wraps around the trunk of the tree descending

Several torches flicker around the dwelling, sending smoke spiralling up into

sentries, and allow passing elves to access a staircase built into the side
of the trunk leading further up the tree. Several supply racks hang from
the wide trunk of the mighty vallenwood, stocked with arrows, string, and
various supplies. A narrow wooden staircase climbs further up the tree

massive vallenwood tree, almost a hundred feet above the forest floor. Wide
bridges stretch north and south, supported by strong, wide vallenwood
branches. Torches are positioned along both sides of the wooden bridge
creating a stunning, flickering effect high in the leafy canopy. This
perch offers a bird's eye view of the village below, where small domed huts
pepper the rolling forest terrain. Several wood and leather lodges are
constructed higher in the trees, partially obscured by the thick, leafy
foliage. Two watchstands are positioned nearby, one to the north and another

rack is fastened to the vallenwood's trunk stocked with supplies and

A Massive Platform Bridging the Dense Forest
    A wide, wooden platform encircles the southern side of a mighty
vallenwood trunk, supported by massive arching branches that curl upward
like giant fingers. A large wooden lodge graces the eastern edge of the
platform and is shaded by the huge yellow-green vallenwood foliage. The
platform's wide construction also acts as a main thoroughfare through the
maze-like network of bridges, platforms, and ladders, connecting the
eastern and western sections of the villages, which cannot be accessed
through the dense forest below. A sturdy wooden railing forms the perimeter
of the large platform, and several flickering torches illuminate platform
and surrounding area. A wooden staircase winds down the vallenwood to the
east, where the dense foliage gives way to more open forest near the base
of a looming ridge.

Towering Totems Among the Trees
    Thick, brown trunks curve upward, creating a cavernous feel to this
section of the verdant forest. Dark green ivy covers the rolling forest
terrain, hiding the dips, ruts and fallen branches along the earth's
surface. Long, twisted vines hang from the maze of thick branches overhead,
some close enough to reach from ground level. Several tall gray boulders
rest to the east, with a path winding between them deeper into the canopied
forest. Two tall wooden totems are anchored in the ground on both sides of
the rocks, each masterfully carved with menacing faces prominent near the
tops. The rhythmic sounds of steady drum beats echo through the forest from
a nearby, unknown source.

    A wide, sprawling oak flourishes below the umbrage of larger brown
giants forming a majestic domed canopy high above the rolling forest
terrain. A massive lodge is constructed in the neck of the giant oak with a
wide, circular platform at the tree's base. Several benches have been
carved from wide logs to provide seating on the wide platform, all facing a
large sculpted chair nestled in the bole of the large oak. Large torches

    A wide, sprawling oak flourishes below the umbrage of larger brown
giants forming a majestic domed canopy high above the rolling forest
terrain. A massive lodge is constructed in the neck of the giant oak with a
wide, circular platform at the tree's base. Several benches have been
carved from wide logs to provide seating on the wide platform, all facing a
large sculpted chair nestled in the bole of the large oak. Large torches
are mounted around the perimeter of the wide platform, sending thin trails
of smoke spiraling upward into the leafy canopy. Small plank steps spiral
up the tree from the wooden platform to the leather-bound hut partially
obscured in the thick tree's foliage. A large bonfire roars near the
platform's base filling the area with warm, soothing heat. A large weapons

The Lodge of the Chieftain
    A wide, sprawling oak flourishes below the umbrage of larger brown
giants forming a majestic domed canopy high above the rolling forest
terrain. A massive lodge is constructed in the neck of the giant oak with a
wide, circular platform at the tree's base. Several benches have been
carved from wide logs to provide seating on the wide platform, all facing a
large sculpted chair nestled in the bole of the large oak. Large torches
are mounted around the perimeter of the wide platform, sending thin trails
of smoke spiraling upward into the leafy canopy. Small plank steps spiral
up the tree from the wooden platform to the leather-bound hut partially
obscured in the thick tree's foliage. A large bonfire roars near the
platform's base filling the area with warm, soothing heat. A large weapons
rack is lashed between two large trunks on the perimeter of the clearing,
partially obscured by the blazing fire.

Towering Totems Among the Trees
    Thick, brown trunks curve upward, creating a cavernous feel to this
section of the verdant forest. Dark green ivy covers the rolling forest
terrain, hiding the dips, ruts and fallen branches along the earth's
surface. Long, twisted vines hang from the maze of thick branches overhead,
some close enough to reach from ground level. Several tall gray boulders
rest to the east, with a path winding between them deeper into the canopied
forest. Two tall wooden totems are anchored in the ground on both sides of
the rocks, each masterfully carved with menacing faces prominent near the
tops. The rhythmic sounds of steady drum beats echo through the forest from

A Massive Platform Bridging the Dense Forest
    A wide, wooden platform encircles the southern side of a mighty
vallenwood trunk, supported by massive arching branches that curl upward
like giant fingers. A large wooden lodge graces the eastern edge of the
platform and is shaded by the huge yellow-green vallenwood foliage. The
platform's wide construction also acts as a main thoroughfare through the
maze-like network of bridges, platforms, and ladders, connecting the
eastern and western sections of the villages, which cannot be accessed
through the dense forest below. A sturdy wooden railing forms the perimeter
of the large platform, and several flickering torches illuminate platform
and surrounding area. A wooden staircase winds down the vallenwood to the
east, where the dense foliage gives way to more open forest near the base
of a looming ridge.

foliage. A watchstand is constructed along the western edge of the platform
offering a bird's eye view over the heart of the elven village. A weapons
rack is fastened to the vallenwood's trunk stocked with supplies and
weapons. Several leather-bound lodges are constructed high in the trees,
connected by a labyrinth of bridges, platforms, and ladders. The platform

A Platform High in the Vallenwoods

massive vallenwood tree, almost a hundred feet above the forest floor. Wide
bridges stretch north and south, supported by strong, wide vallenwood
branches. Torches are positioned along both sides of the wooden bridge
creating a stunning, flickering effect high in the leafy canopy. This
perch offers a bird's eye view of the village below, where small domed huts
pepper the rolling forest terrain. Several wood and leather lodges are
constructed higher in the trees, partially obscured by the thick, leafy
foliage. Two watchstands are positioned nearby, one to the north and another
to the south to keep vigil over the elven village.

A Watchstand Overlooking the Village
    A large wooden perch is constructed around the base of a tall
vallenwood, offering a bird's eye view of the northeastern edge of the
elven village. The wide platform has ample room to support several elven
sentries, and allow passing elves to access a staircase built into the side
of the trunk leading further up the tree. Several supply racks hang from
the wide trunk of the mighty vallenwood, stocked with arrows, string, and
various supplies. A narrow wooden staircase climbs further up the tree
where several lodges are barely visible through the thick, leafy canopy. A
narrow bridge leads south toward another large platform.

A Platform High in the Vallenwoods
    A large wooden platform is constructed around the western end of a
massive vallenwood tree, almost a hundred feet above the forest floor. Wide
bridges stretch north and south, supported by strong, wide vallenwood
branches. Torches are positioned along both sides of the wooden bridge
creating a stunning, flickering effect high in the leafy canopy. This
perch offers a bird's eye view of the village below, where small domed huts
pepper the rolling forest terrain. Several wood and leather lodges are
constructed higher in the trees, partially obscured by the thick, leafy
foliage. Two watchstands are positioned nearby, one to the north and another
to the south to keep vigil over the elven village.

A Watchstand Overlooking the Village
    A large platform encircles the brown trunk of a hulking vallenwood,
braced by thick branches and partially camouflaged by dense yellow-green
foliage. A watchstand is constructed along the western edge of the platform
offering a bird's eye view over the heart of the elven village. A weapons
rack is fastened to the vallenwood's trunk stocked with supplies and
weapons. Several leather-bound lodges are constructed high in the trees,
connected by a labyrinth of bridges, platforms, and ladders. The platform
also permits access to bridges spanning north and east, leading to other

A Massive Platform Bridging the Dense Forest
    A wide, wooden platform encircles the southern side of a mighty
vallenwood trunk, supported by massive arching branches that curl upward
like giant fingers. A large wooden lodge graces the eastern edge of the
platform and is shaded by the huge yellow-green vallenwood foliage. The
platform's wide construction also acts as a main thoroughfare through the
maze-like network of bridges, platforms, and ladders, connecting the
eastern and western sections of the villages, which cannot be accessed
through the dense forest below. A sturdy wooden railing forms the perimeter
of the large platform, and several flickering torches illuminate platform
and surrounding area. A wooden staircase winds down the vallenwood to the
east, where the dense foliage gives way to more open forest near the base
of a looming ridge.

Towering Totems Among the Trees
    Thick, brown trunks curve upward, creating a cavernous feel to this
section of the verdant forest. Dark green ivy covers the rolling forest
terrain, hiding the dips, ruts and fallen branches along the earth's
surface. Long, twisted vines hang from the maze of thick branches overhead,
some close enough to reach from ground level. Several tall gray boulders
rest to the east, with a path winding between them deeper into the canopied
forest. Two tall wooden totems are anchored in the ground on both sides of
the rocks, each masterfully carved with menacing faces prominent near the
tops. The rhythmic sounds of steady drum beats echo through the forest from
a nearby, unknown source.

The Lodge of the Chieftain
    A wide, sprawling oak flourishes below the umbrage of larger brown
giants forming a majestic domed canopy high above the rolling forest
terrain. A massive lodge is constructed in the neck of the giant oak with a
wide, circular platform at the tree's base. Several benches have been
carved from wide logs to provide seating on the wide platform, all facing a
large sculpted chair nestled in the bole of the large oak. Large torches
are mounted around the perimeter of the wide platform, sending thin trails
of smoke spiraling upward into the leafy canopy. Small plank steps spiral
up the tree from the wooden platform to the leather-bound hut partially
obscured in the thick tree's foliage. A large bonfire roars near the
platform's base filling the area with warm, soothing heat. A large weapons
rack is lashed between two large trunks on the perimeter of the clearing,
partially obscured by the blazing fire.

A Cluster of Huts
    A large cluster of warriors' huts circle the base of a massive drooping
weeping willow tree. A small campfire burns to the south several paces from
the huts perimeter where several logs are arranged for seating. A charred
black cook pot rests near the fire ready to be hung over the fire for the
next meal. Several weapons racks fully stocked with spears, bows and an
assortment of supplies are sheltered by a leather flap tied between several
tree trunks. The forest chimes to the tune of exotic song birds which soar
from treetop to treetop composing a splendid forest symphony. A small
wooden platform only a few paces in diameter is perched high in the air
over the camp in a tall thin tree providing a bird's eye view of the
campsite. A narrow trail runs north and east through the forest
disappearing in both directions in the thick, lush foliage.

A Hidden Perch
    The massive branch underfoot gently descends and intersects with an
immense trunk. Both the branch and trunk of this mammoth tree are wide and
strong enough to hold creatures of almost any size securely. The crux at
the branch's stem forms an almost perfect cradle to sleep within safely,
with no fear of falling out of the tree. The perch also offers a good view
of the forest nearly twenty feet below, while remaining virtually
undetectable from the ground behind the tree's cover of leaves. This seems
like a highly useful spot of real estate for any crafty predator.

    The immense boughs of a mammoth tree nearby cast a shadow that envelops

indistinguishable from any other. This may not be the center of the forest
from a geographic standpoint, but it is certainly the center of things from
a more abstract, spiritual perspective. The sensation of calmness and bliss
is incredibly powerful here, along with an alluring and almost irresistible
pull of deep slumber. The spirit of the living forest pulls at the mind,
struggling to drag invaders deep into a dream where they can do no harm.
Only with strong mental fortitude can the pull be evaded, and only the most

The Heart of the Sacred Forest
    The immense boughs of a mammoth tree nearby cast a shadow that envelops
the entire area and nearly blots out the sun and moon. If not for the
incredible tree this section of the forest would be virtually
indistinguishable from any other. This may not be the center of the forest
from a geographic standpoint, but it is certainly the center of things from
a more abstract, spiritual perspective. The sensation of calmness and bliss
is incredibly powerful here, along with an alluring and almost irresistible
pull of deep slumber. The spirit of the living forest pulls at the mind,
struggling to drag invaders deep into a dream where they can do no harm.
Only with strong mental fortitude can the pull be evaded, and only the most
disciplined minds are able to maintain a coherent train of thought.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration

sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
