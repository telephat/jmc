Gobble Gobble!

Wild turkeys have been unleashed on the world of Krynn. They have begun to
run rampant across the roads, forests, and mountains of the world. Seek out
and hunt these avian menaces, but be sure to keep safe the prized feathers
you pluck from their carcasses. Special awards (coins, equipment) will be
given to the players who hoard the most feathers.

The event will run from Thursday, November 23rd at 12:00AM UTC till Monday,
November 27th at 11:59PM UTC.

Seek out Kyuss at the end of the event to collect your prize.

The gods would like to give thanks to our loyal player base who continue to
enjoy our humble game. During this time a triple double bonus will be in
effect. All experience, coins, and ranks will be doubled.

Better late than never...?

The farmers in the lands near Kalaman Graveyard report midnight sightings
of mysterious shapes and shadows in their pumpkin patches - yes, this means
it is once again [late, at our miserable failure] the spooky season here on
Arctic MUD!

As of this announcement, our much-beloved Haunted Mansion Halloween zone
has been linked to the game [several days late.] Multiple groups or solo
players will be able to explore this area simultaneously and individually,
due to its instanced nature. The Haunted Mansion will be available to
challenge until Monday, November 12th at 12:00AM UTC.

As mentioned, the Halloween instance zone has been linked several days late,
but it will remain in the game a bit longer than usual. I take full
responsibility for the slacking of the upper immortal staff to link this
Holiday zone in a timely manner. 

Hope you enjoy and may you all die,

As the flames of summer subside and the cool, twilight breeze whispers of
autumnal homecoming, so too do the acolyte scholars of the Library of
Palanthas return from their erudite journeys. One such follower of Gilean,
nearly tripping over his own feet as he climbs the red stone steps, bears
an important yet forgotten missive from lands afar. Creased brows wrinkle
as Astinus quickly scans the parchment, his eyes widening with each line.
The ancient man stops suddenly, and a timeless phrase resounds within the
minds of all the denizens of Krynn:

"...triple double..."

The gods of Arctic have bestowed upon you a 'triple double' weekend
scheduled to begin Friday, August 18th 12:00PM UTC and running until
Monday, August 21st 11:59PM UTC. During this time, players will receive
double experience, ranks, and coins.

Thanks for playing Arctic!

    In the middle of summer, when the sun is shining its brightest, the
barriers between different magical realms become weaker.

    During this time, followers of druidic arts usually perform special
rituals to celebrate the powerful Elementals. However, t
here have been
reports of a sad accident during one of these ceremonies in Sandy Cove,
south of Balifor. If a portal opens between these realms, we don't know
what creatures might come through and what dangers they could bring to our
world. To avoid potential problems, we need to act quickly.

    The Midsummer event is limited to 24 hours, so each person can only
participate once during this time. The event also has a strict time limit
of 90 minutes. If someone dies during the event, their body will be removed
from the magical portal a few minutes after the event ends. The celebration
lasts for several weeks, offering a break from the hot summer weather, and
many people choose to stay indoors.

    We want to thank Jorquin for creating this temporary but beautiful
magical zone, and Alecto for helping with the descriptions of the different
areas.

Rejoice, Adventurers, for the gods of Krynn have smiled warmly upon the
lands and have bestowed upon you an extended triple double bonus weekend.

We'd like to remember you, the players who have been enjoying our game for
over 30 years. Thank you for visiting our game and exploring all of the new
and old content, as well as the numerous bugs, typos, and idea reports that
help us improve the game.

The bonus event will take place between Friday May 26th 12:00PM UTC and
Monday May 29th 11:59PM UTC. During this time, players will receive double
experience, rank, and coins.

Enjoy and go forth and slay!

The barmaids, tavern keepers, and plentiful other purveyors of the potent
potables of Krynn describe strange sightings of little green men. The
ruddy-faced munchkins wander from city to city, pinching passersby as they
go and generally causing a debauched ruckus. Stalwart adventurers might
seek to give these leprechauns a 'pinch' of their own medicine, collecting
their chromatic charms for certain future profit (and luck).

A St. Patrick's Day bonus event will run from March 17, 2023 00:00 UTC to
March 20, 2023 23:59 UTC. Players can collect various rainbow fragments
from wandering leprechauns, which may be turned in for rewards after the
event ends (see your closest 34+ for assistance).

Players will receive 100% bonus experience for the duration of the event.

                         Happy New Year!

Several code bugs have been addressed:

 * Thieves can no longer backstab with lances.
 * Shamans can brew while standing in their guild, similar to other
   classes.
 * The reincarnation menu text is updated for current times.
 * 'Sap strength' no longer displays the victim name to the victim.
 * 'Legendary Gore' fumble chance has increased significantly. (We may need
   to readjust the chance, pending further testing and player feedback.)
 * All fooms from this wipe are debugge
d and fixed.

Many items remain on our list, especially 'creation' (zone) issues for
newer content. Please continue to report obvious issues with the 'bug'
command and we'll fix things as we have time.

                         Happy Holidays!

The odd, yet familiar, jingling of bells outside the western gate of
Palanthas can mean but one thing: Sandy Klorze is coming to town.

Visit his legendary toy factory in this seasonal Christmas Instance zone.
The zone has a 24-hour lockout, meaning each character can only enter once
per 24 hours. There is also a 90 minute timer to complete an instance.
Should players perish in the instance, their corpses will automatically be
ejected from the factory after the instance expires (approximately 5
minutes after being empty, or when the 'timeout' timer expires, whichever
happens first.)

The zone will be available between now and New Year's Day.

From the entire Arctic Staff, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all!

A couple 'quests' bug have been fixed today:

  - Alchemy should allow progression beyond the first step.
  - A small bug in the Paladin Rose quest chain was fixed.

we'll work to resolve them.

  We realize the new item colors are pretty, but this is not an excuse
to hoard limited items on low level characters.

       Storage characters are forbidden. Do not use them.

  We have reclaimed gear from several of these and returned it to
circulation for those who will use it on their primary characters.
We will continue to zap rents as deemed necessary.

                    Welcome to the new wipe.

    The game opening went as smoothly as can be possible. Nearly 250
characters were concurrently online opening day, and after 42 hours of
uptime, several characters have already reached level 30.

The following bugs were fixed in the recent reboot:

  - Breach no longer attempts to rescue the victim of the barbarian.
  - Having 'opt ANSI_PLUS' enabled no longer breaks the 'group' display.
  - Colorized 'glowing' items no longer display color in the room
    description for invisible or hiding mobiles.
  - Several other bugs related to 'creation' (zones.)

We hope everyone is enjoying the wipe thus far!

GENERAL
-------
* PROMPT WATCH, WATCH_OPP, COND, TIC_TIMER are now on by default.
* OPT TARGET_WATCH_OPP is now on by default.
* OPT IGNORE_MASS_TELEPORT is now disabled by default.
* All characters will ignore domain checks by default. See: HELP OPTIONS
    DOMAIN.
* LFG tag will still work while grouped. See: HELP OPTIONS LFG.
* Charisma can no longer go under 1. (bug fix) 
* Being immune to an element no longer provides healing when struck by the
    element.
* New social: mooch 
* The 'systat' command now shows the game PK damage percent value.
* Player vs player damage is (still) set to 75%.
* 'Browse' support added for vault. (See: HELP BROWSE)
* 'Browse' support added for wear location. (browse head)
* Browse (world merchant and vaults only) can filter IDENTIFIED items by
    affects, flags, and anti-class flags.

    Examples:
       'browse damroll' : Display items with DAMROLL.
       'browse sense_life' : Display items with SENSE_LIFE.
       'browse !nowarrior' : Display items usable by WARRIOR.
       'browse infravision !nothief' : Browse INFRAVISION, for THIEF usable.

* The 'fight' code was heavily refactored to be safer and cleaner. We
tested extensively, but please let the staff know immediately if skills or
anything in normal combat behaves strangely.


NEW SYSTEMS
------------
ANSI colorized items:

    !!! Please make your character creation selections carefully. !!!
    !!! New menu options are present during character creation. !!!

    Colorization of equipment has been added to the game. Equipped, carried
    objects, and objects otherwise seen in corpses and containers, will
    display in color if they are notable by type or rarity.

    The immortal staff have attempted to pick the best options for newer
    and older clients. Colors may be adjusted later based on player
    feedback, but we hope our initial preset provides a bit of fun,
    surprise, and most importantly, a quality of life element to the game.

    New options have been added to accompany these changes:
        - OPTIONS NO_ITEM_COLORS
            -- Disable the display of all item colorizing
        - OPTIONS ANSI_PLUS
            -- Toggled ON, displays full 256-bit extended ANSI color
            -- Toggled OFF, supports safe 8-bit ANSI color scale

    * Note: Older MUD clients may not support extended ANSI and will not
    experience the system as intended. The notable ones which do not
    support extended ANSI are WinTin95, zMUD, and JMC (main development
    branch.) If items are 'blinking,' 'not displayed,' or otherwise do not
    appear to be viewed correctly, we recommend toggling 'opt ANSI_PLUS'
    off or upgrading to a newer client.

    The immortal staff provides some safe client configurations for clients
    which support extended ANSI: http://arcticmud.org/pages/clients.html

Achievements:

    Completing certain tasks around the game may award achievements.

    Currently these are 'player only' and have no tie-ins to clans. We've
    added some fun surprises, but we didn't have the time to add nearly as
    many as we hoped. This is a developmental system which we plan to
    expand upon in the future. There is a lot of room for improvement with
    this system, so please use the 'idea' command to submit suggestions.

CLANS STRONGHOLDS
-----------------
* Clan strongholds will have a door at their entrance, created by default.
* A new room is available for purchase: Training Grounds. (See: HELP
    STRONGHOLD ASSETS)
* Arenas assets have increased in cost.
* Players will no longer be able to teleport to strongholds of clans other
    than their own.


RANKS
-----
* Rank merchants have evaluated supply and demand trends and thus adjusted
    prices for a small number of ranks. Most notably "Iron Man" and
    "Braincage" are more expensive, while "Captain Planet" and
    "Heartseeker" have been reduced in cost.


RACES
-----
* Humans will receive a small bonus to all weapon and guild skills.
* Humans will receive a small rent discount wherever they rent.
* Daergar can be Dark Knights. 
* Vry-Kith 'mantises' have evolved into the insect race.
* Behirs can no longer be ridden as mounts.


NEWBIE AREAS
------------
* Surges in the populations of minor critters have been reported in many of
    the major cities of Krynn. The following areas are now infested with an
    endless supply of insects, vermin, or other animals:

    - Tarsis sewers
    - Tarsis park
    - Palanthas sewers
    - Balifor garbage dump (upper)

* The Kalaman park area has undergone renovations and is now the home of a
    seemingly endless amount of small animals. The Druid's guild has moved
    slightly, though is still within the immediate area.


ZONE EXPANSIONS AND REVAMPS
----------------------------
* Blood Sea - The Blood Sea of Istar is a churning, salt-sprayed wasteland
    gleaming with crimson waters. The sea allows access to many of Krynn's
    secrets, stretching from Flotsam to Dragon's Point, and from the
    Mistlestraits to Mithas. While the outer edges of the seas are safe for
    mid level adventurers (15+), only brave or foolhardy adventurers (25+)
    should dare the eastern edges of the sea or the terrible Maelstrom at
    its center.

* Dragon's Point - Dragon's Point has been rebuilt by the denizens of the
    village. The more steadfast village is best to be explored by higher
    neutral-aligned mid-high (18-22) level adventurers seeking new
    experiences.

* Icefolk Village - Aspiring adventurers (12-17) should be able to invade
    the neutral-aligned village of Icefolk and hunt the common creatures in
    the surrounding forests. Challenging the village's elders or the apex
    predators in the area, however, is best suited to more seasoned
    adventurers (18-22).

* Illyoc Swamp - Eager adventurers with moderate experience (12-18) should
    be able to investigate the swamplands and hunt its various neutral
    inhabitants. However, some of the more powerful denizens might be more
    suited to hardened veterans (18-22).

* Pigmy Forest - Budding adventurers with limited expertise (12-18) should
    be able to investigate the Pigmy Forests in their totality and
    challenge the evil tribe.

* Rockhorde Peninsula - Rumors of undead pirates haunting the caverns of
    the Rockhorde Peninsula have spread through the region. Adventurers of
    moderate strength (16-22) should be able to investigate. The pirates
    have been reported as being malevolent, but neutral in alignment.

* Xak Tsaroth, renamed "The Cursed Lands" - Once a vibrant forest, these
    lands became forsaken after the Cataclysm struck and all that remains
    is a dismal swamp. Rumors spread speaking of a Red Dragonarmy invasion
    of the lands that buffed the space between Solace and the swamp. Only
    those that have acquired powerful abilities (20-24) should attempt to
    delve deeper into the cursed lands.
        -- The "heal quest" entrance location has changed, but the rest of
            the quest remains the same.

NEW ZONES
----------
* Dairly Plains - The Dairly Plains are vast fields of swaying grasses and
    rolling savanna along the easternmost section of the continent of
    Ansalon. Past the Laughing Lands and the Goblin Hills, these verdant
    fields have been the homeland of the Dairly plainsmen since before the
    Cataclysm. Both the Goblin Hills and the Dairly Plains are filled with
    mysterious and ancient secrets, as well as powerful enemies, requiring
    groups of high level adventurers to fully explore.

* Library of Khrystan - Rumors have spread throughout the Plains of Dust of
    a sealed library hidden beneath the city of Tarsis. The library's
    ancient and abundant knowledge will be revealed to mid level explorers
    who are able to find it.

* Monastery of the White Orchid - The heavy snows have finally cleared the
    summits of the Dirim Peaks, revealing a nearly-forgotten path up the
    mountains. While the way is treacherous, neutral-aligned mid-level
    explorers can brave the cold to the summits where an ancient ground of
    monks, disconnected from civilization, now anticipates visits from
    adventurers, friend or foe.

* Palanthas Wastes - The area east of Palanthas has been expanded to
    include the Palanthas Wastes. Two s
ignal towers rise up to protect the
    Bay of Branchala, while the villages of Ash and Scorpi have settled
    amongst the wastes for mid level neutral-aligned adventurers to visit
    and explore the surrounding areas.

* Ruins of Xak Tsaroth - The Dragonarmies continue to expand, settling in
    the ancient yet forgotten ruins of Xak Tsaroth east of Solace.
    Adventurers have discovered an entrance to the ruins of Xak Tsaroth
    through the swamps of the Cursed Lands. Exploring the new depths of the
    lost city should only be attempted by very experienced adventurers
    [28+].

MISCELLANEOUS WORLD AND QUEST CHANGES
-------------------------------------
* The quests code received a major refactor. This required recreating all
    quests in the game in a very short amount of time. (Thanks Rhak!) We
    believe all quests are working, but please 'bug' report anything minor
    that is not working, and shout for a 34+ immortal for major bugs or
    stuck characters.
* The infamous 'zombie ship' may be found patrolling new waters.
* A particular black cat is now much more approachable by adventurers, but
    has had her possession rebalanced accordingly.
* The path to Crystal Quest has changed. Maps will need to be redrawn. 
* The Sandy Cove 'Sand Castle' zone south of Balifor has vanished. Time
    will tell as to whether it will be missed or not.
* Cartographers and sign builders have been busy. It should be easier to
    navigate major road and water systems across the game.
* Amity has reclaimed ownership of her favorite shield. Do not expect her
    to give it up without a change in tactics.
* Rumors have been circulating of a plot to reanimate a powerful blue
    dragon that died in combat many years ago. Whether there is any truth
    to these stories is not clear, but the mightiest adventurers may wish
    to investigate further to ensure the ongoing safety of Krynn.
* The quest for a certain fungal weapon has had appropriate hints added and
    can now be solved through legitimate means.
* An issue which prevented some of Boras Trueforge's items being crafted
    was fixed, however all of his creations have been rebalanced.
* Several zones with an excessive amount of rank mobs, predominantly lower
    level zones, have been changed to be more in line with other areas.


ITEM CHANGES
------------
* 'Dynamic item' loads have been adjusted across the game and added to new
    zones.
* A significant portion of the items from Blood Shoal have changed
    locations across Krynn. Some will have new names to reflect their new
    home. Some will not.
* Most items which provided damage reductions have been rebalanced,
    generally resulting in these reductions being reduced or removed
    entirely. This includes a couple set bonuses.
* Several items with specials that reduced incoming damage were changed to
    be more balanced.
* Many items have been touched, especially regarding 'limits.' Most have
    increased to varying degrees, while a small handful of powerful items
    have been reduced.
* Numerous 'low limit' items that never decayed in rent (or at all) now do.
* Fine leather will have the same cast restrictions as rough leather.
* For unknown reasons, the base weight of corpse objects has been five
    times heavier than designed. This has been corrected. (bug fix)
* Creamy potions of flight are now rentable.
* New character training weapons can no longer be disarmed.
* All major towns now sell scrolls of legend lore.
* World merchants now buy bows.
* Jenna sells affinity medals again. We're taking our best stab at fixing
    the 'deadbeat' bug with medals, but the "no reimbursements" stance will
    apply to restorations of medals lost in rent bankruptcy this wipe,
    until we have more data.
* Shopkeepers no longer destroy items by default when items are given to
    them.
* Shopkeepers no longer sell vellum scrolls. The associated piece of master
    alchemy was removed.
* Wooden chests are now available for purchase in most cities and towns. In
    some others, existing containers had their size altered to match that
    of a wooden chest.
* Motes generated from draining 'casting level' gear are greatly reduced in
    power. (bug fix)

SPELLS/SKILLS (GENERAL)
-----------------------
* Players' memlist will ignore lost bonus spell slots at death.
* Casters can now forget a specified number spells. (See HELP FORGET, HELP
    MEM)  Example:  forget 3 'magic missile'

Barbarians:
----------
* Barbarians have learned to use pole arms. 
* Barbarians have learned to sharpen rapiers, pikes, and spears.
* The misspelling of the "legendary lore" rank has been fixed. Its effects
    and bonuses have been changed to suit the correct spelling of
    "legendary gore."

Clerics:
----------
* Bandage is now learned at level 4.
* 'Healing mist' no longer provides more than one healing effect per combat
    round, per caster. (Multiple casters can effectively cast together, but
    only one healing mist will be effective per caster.)
* 'Legendary Healing Mist' bonuses will only apply when the cleric is in
    the room with the mist.
* 'Healing mist' now benefits from the caster's healing bonus.
* The heal over time effect applied by 'Legendary Heal' has been reduced.

Druids:
-------
* 'Plant walk' will allow druids to safely pass through their own 'barrier'
    spell.
* Druids have received the 'web,' 'poison,' and 'whispering wind' spells,
    which can be learned at the guild.
* Druids can now recast their
 'healing cloud' if they already have an
    active cloud or have had it destroyed, however only one cloud will be
    active per round.
* 'Granite hand' has replaced 'stone skin' in the spell requirements for
    Legendary Druid.

Mages (Magic Users & Robes):
----------------------------
* The 'deep pockets' timer applied to items has more than doubled.
* Damage bonuses for having casting level over 30 have been halved.
* Due to a majority vote by players, 'locate object' has been removed from
    spell books, objects, and scrolls. We're trying something new here with
    the new creation content and reshuffling of gear. The spell may be
    readded later, time will tell. A number of formerly 'locatable' spell
    load %s have slightly increased due to this change, but not higher than
    their 'death load' counterparts in any case.

Black Robes:
------------
* While under the effects of 'mind inversion,' players will see a special
    prompt.
* 'Arcane tunnel' will no longer fail when cast on party members.
* 'Soulkeep' is no longer siphonable.
* 'Acid mist' can now trigger black robe secondary effects.

Red Robes:
----------
* The paralysis chance from Legendary 'lightning orb' has been reduced.
* When an eye summoned by the 'wizard eye' spell is slain, its master will
    receive a message.
* 'Read magic' will provide a learn bonus to the spell caster for studying
    their own book they have successfully penetrated with magic.
* 'Blastwave' has switched places in spell circle and load-tier with
    'lightning orb.'

White Robes:
------------
* White robe secondary effects no longer stack on targets. 
* 'Delayed blast fireball' can trigger white robe secondary effects.

Dark Knights:
-------------
* 'Blindness' has been moved to 2nd circle.
* 'Free action' has been moved to 3rd circle.
* 'Poison' has been added at 3rd circle.
* Daergar can be Dark Knights. 

Paladins:
--------
* 'Cure serious' has been moved to 3rd circle. 
* 'Holy arms' can be recast while already affected by it.

Scouts:
------
* Lag from using the 'instinct' command has been reduced.
