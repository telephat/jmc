archaeologists of the next age to find and revere my name as one of the great
keepers of history.
    My name is Ghilan of Neraka.  I grew up bruised and battered on the streets
in that good for nothing town.  The experience has made me what I am today,
though, so I cannot complain.  I was found laying near death on the street by
the one known as The Dark Mage (who currently resides in a flying citadel).  He
taught me the ways of magic and taught me that cruelty was the only way to
accomplish my goals and ambitions.  It brings a smile to my face to remember the
day I hired out Onyx to kill him so I could take over his citadel.

    Baerul resides in a pocket dimension created beside Gar's temple.  The
priests spend most of their time trying to summon creatures to feed his
insatiable appetite.  They have been known to gate in creatures from other
planes of existance as well as summoning (via the spell) unsuspecting
travelers.
   As a side note, it should be noted that Onyx dissapproves of this
practice.  Despite the Arrogant One's confidence that she will always overcome,
she grows wary of bringing in unknowns to her guild.  She knows very well
the havoc _that_ can cause.

It is fortunate that he sometimes can't do even that simple job right, it

    Onyx has one hell of a sense of humor.  She had me set up a force field
right before her treasure room.  Inside contains some of her wealth, but it
keeps expanding.  Every time people attempt to enter her treasure room, a
spell activates, stripping them of all their belongings, dumping it all in the
room. The first time I tested it, my assistant got transported before Baerul,
who got an unexpected mid day snack.  Luckily, I was able to retrieve his
