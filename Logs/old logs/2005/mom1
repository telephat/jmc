    The wind has gotten stronger here and it howls loudly as it blows
ceaselessly through the corridors of the rift. You smell a slight hint of
smoke in the air and the familiar smell of a cook fire somewhere nearby.
Frantically, you search about for the source and looking upwards, you see
more of the familiar handholds dotting the icy wall to the south. You try
to see where the handholds lead, but the darkness permits you no foresight.
The corpse of a frost giant warrior is lying here.
