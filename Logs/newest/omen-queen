l staff
This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.
..it glows dimly

l runes
The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

As you recite the ancient rune words, the tiny jewels on the polished
bone staff begin to glow. First, the emeralds flash to life, followed
by the rubies and then the topazes. Finally, a bright blue ray of
light bursts forth from the the large sapphire and strikes the small
Bokor Queen full in the chest.

As the light strikes her, the nimbus surrounding the Bokor Queen dims
slightly, and she suddenly lurches forward and breaks free of the
invisible forces binding her!
