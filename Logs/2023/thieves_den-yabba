The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A grime covered board is here.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

A Small Alley
    A small alley leading away from the big streets. The alley seems quite
dirty, there are trash cans piled all over. The street cleaners sometimes
dump their trash in here. Since not too many regular folks come here, it is
left neglected.

This place is so different from the rest of the town, you would think you
were in another lesser city. The city really needs to clean up this
section, but people are afraid of the crime here. There is a small house to
the west with its doors open, you see a few shady looking characters enter
but they didn't come back out.

A Small Alley
    A small alley leading away from the big streets. The alley seems quite
dirty, there are trash cans piled all over. The street cleaners sometimes
dump their trash in here. Since not too many regular folks come here, it is
left neglected.

This place is so different from the rest of the town, you would think you
were in another lesser city. The city really needs to clean up this
section, but people are afraid of the crime here. There is a small house to
the west with its doors open, you see a few shady looking characters enter
but they didn't come back out.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
