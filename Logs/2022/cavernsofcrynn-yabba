A Mountain Trail
    A large tree rooted to the side of the trail threatens to tumble down
the mountain side into the ogre village below. The trail here, while
mountainous, is relatively flat and straight, but to the north it clearly
becomes a much more difficult journey. Of course, the trail also leads east
toward the gates of the dwarven keep.

peel moss
You decide to attempt scraping the large patch of blotched moss off the
rocks. Just as you begin to detach the moss from its home, you notice
movement from inside!

You jump back a few feet and scream...

Thousands of tiny orange mites tear across the room and into the chasm to
the north, carefully avoiding your feet and equipment on the floor.  When
the procession seems through, you carefully proceed to pull the moss the
rest of the way off of the rocks.  Some kind of old device, probably of
gnomish descent, is uncovered in the process.
