To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,

strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
