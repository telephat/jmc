THE VILLAGE OF RIGITT
=====================

BACKGROUND:

The town of Rigitt is a small but prosperous fishing village under the
extended rule of Tarsis. The seasonal fishing in Ice Mountain Bay has been
plentiful for several years, leading to rapid development of Rigitt and
its bustling marina.

The new-found wealth in the area has drawn the interest of many merchants
who have built profitable shops and stalls around the village. Hundreds of
fishermen visit the bay's waters to cast their fishing lines and sell their
catch in the town's local fish market.

The marina of Rigitt is frequented by trade ships from all over Ansalon,
keeping the bustling deckhands occupied throughout the day. Ferries along
the southern docks of the village provide transportation to several other
coastal towns around Ansalon.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The town of Rigitt is safe for all to explore, assuming the drunken sailors
don't try to pick a fight. Mid-high level adventurers [16-25] may find
suitable challenges and rare goods around the area.

LOCATION:

The Village of Rigitt has been established along the northeast coast of Ice
Mountain Bay, immediately to the south of Tarsis and a short distance west
of Zeeriak.
