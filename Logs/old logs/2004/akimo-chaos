Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Caster sees a vision of victim's location

probing.

Sphere   : Enchantment
Usage    : cast 'recharge' [object in inventory]

Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Tells caster where an object is

number of objects it locates depends on the level of the caster.  The
distance it searches depends on the caster's level, and on some random
variance.
