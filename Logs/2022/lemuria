of a higher order there is a simple, recessed circle.

Beneath the Vast Ocean

seems to have been filtered through a blue lens, and everything looks wispy
and tenuous. Several large strands of seaweed drift by. From here, you can
move in any direction.

sunlight from the surface world has been filtered out by the water to
almost nothing, and the faint glow which remains leaves much to the

Above, the ocean brightens into a circle of blue light, and below it fades
into total darkness. All around you the faint haze continues, and you think
you can see several large shapes moving through the water.
