waters. A few gulls dare the gusty blasts, cawing loudly over the roar of
the ocean.

CASTLE DREAD
============

BACKGROUND:

Lying along the cold, isolated shores of Nostar, along the Sirrion Sea,
Castle Dread guards terrible secrets and an ancient past. The brave 
Nostarians have been locked in an epic battle with the shadow wraiths who
have taken a foothold in the northern part of the island, locked away from
the mortals who mill about the township. The Dread Citadel, at the center 
of the embattled town is home to Lord Isaakar and Lady Kindle, and guarded
with the fiercest warriors of the island. Those who have traveled to the
distant island of Nostar tell of powerful rocs cawing during the day and 
the whispering wails of the shadow wraiths at night.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

To explore the outer keep of Castle Dread would take a band of high level 
(25+) adventurers, while exploring the deeper confines of the keep would 
take significantly more seasoned explorers (28+).

LOCATION:

Castle Dread lies upon the Isle of Nostar, not far from its sister island
of Enstar. The islands lies along the Sirrion Sea, south of the Elven Arches
of Southern Ergoth, and beyond of the elven lands west of Haven.

sway in the gentle breeze, creaking softly as their needles fall

streams, even though it is impossible to see the streams or the Nostar

    Here there is the edge of the cliff, a few hundred feet below, one can
see the river of languid streams and waterways. Castle Dread stands
ominously in the middle of the river on a giant support undoubtedly
reinforced by ancient magic. This is where the draw bridge is raised and
lowered across the perilous streams or the Nostar river that flows below.
Attached to the surrounding mountain sides are four gigantic chains
connecting to Castle Dread and serve as additional support. One of the
chain links is connected just north of here.

The Drawbridge
    This is the huge draw bridge that connects Castle Dread to the rest of
world. The bridge is made of some strange adamantine material that can
withstand the oxidation from the immense spray, coming from below. The huge
drawbridge is the gates to the fortress city of Castle Dread, it is
connected to a huge mechanism that raises and lowers the drawbridge. When
the drawbridge is lifted, there would be no way to enter Castle Dread from
the ground.

At the Gates of Castle Dread
    Here stands a huge platform outside of Castle Dread's main gates. The
spray rising from the streaming pool below is almost unbearable. Looking
below one can see nothing but watery death. Surrounding Castle Dread are
mountain ranges, there are also three vales that lie to the north,
northeast, and to the south. Almost like a fortress, Castle Dread itself is
directly to the east.

The Dump of Castle Dread
    This is a smelly little place. Much of the garbage of the city has been
dumped here. The dump is actually a large sink hole that drops the trash
out into streaming pool beneath and surrounding the city. It seems to be
clogged at the moment and the trash is piling up.

A Long Corridor
     The corridor is dark and chilly. All around you, you see cold and
shiny surfaces of the obsidian walls reflecting back distorted images of
yourself. This palace is quite large and one can easily get lost, if you
don't get killed first.

The Citadel Entry
    This is in the large entry of the citadel. The massive chamber is
shadowy and chilly. The feel of being here is quite haunting and
threatening. The structure and craftsmanship of this huge citadel is quite
amazing, but the audacity of one's presence makes it difficult to admire
its qualities. To the north and south one can see guard rooms and the rest
of the citadel lies to the east.

At the Gates of the Palace
    Standing in front of the citadel there is a feeling of impending death.
Staring into the uncivilized eyes of twisted stone phoenixes above the
gates that gaze back seemingly with sharpened beaks, as though expecting
one to enter. Entering the citadel seems like a breach of sanity and an act
of foolhardiness.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.
