Ahmed stretches out his crook of gnarled oak and whispers some words...

The crook begins to shudder as new buds sprout all along the twisted old
wood. From the buds grow slender branches and from the branches unfurl a
host of bright green oak leaves till the crook looks more like a freshly
uprooted bush. A moment passes and the branches begin to wither, the leaves
turning bright orange then fire red then finally dark brown. With a passing
wind the dead leaves and branches fall to the ground and the crook is a
crook once more.
