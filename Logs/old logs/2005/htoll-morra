/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be wary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/

/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be wary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/                           
/                                                   -Terk

/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be wary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/

/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be wary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/

is so protective of his daughter. She is easily the most beautiful woman in

ever seen. Raven black hair flows past her waist, held togather in an
intricate braid, and her deep green eyes seem to penetrate you. Unlike the
warrior ways of her people, Moonsong has studied the arts of herbalism and
healing to care for her people in times of war and peace.
