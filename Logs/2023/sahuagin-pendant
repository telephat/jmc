Within the Reef
    Deeper within the massive reef, life down here slows considerably. Or
maybe it only seems that way because it's more difficult to navigate the
coral tunnels. Who knows what little fish and critters may be hiding within
the nooks and crannies of the inner coral. An path through the elkhorn coral
leads back up towards the surface, though it winds in such a way that anyone

    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

An Ornate Hallway
    The hallway through the southern section of the temple is lined with an
assortment of very ornate decorations, though they are displayed in a most
grisly fashion. The severed arms of many different races are affixed to the
eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.

The Chamber of Sekolah
    The water filling this secret chamber is tinted red from the blood of
countless sacrifices. The chamber is bare except for a large bowl filled
with shark teeth and set on a pedestal in the middle of the room. The teeth
seem to move of their own volition despite the stillness of the surrounding
water. A hidden place such as this must be used for only the most important
sacrifices in communion with Sekolah, or for the gruesome rites of passage

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.

An Ornate Hallway
    The hallway through the southern section of the temple is lined with an
assortment of very ornate decorations, though they are displayed in a most
grisly fashion. The severed arms of many different races are affixed to the
eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

An Intersection in the Temple
    The ancient stones of the old human temple are covered in centuries of
grime and filth. The water here is fogged with a thick green sediment which
obscures one's vision. The crude stones give way to porous white coral to
up above and in the tunnel to the north. There, the gloom seems to clear as
clean water gently flows in through the tiny holes in the coral. West from
here, the faint outline of some gigantic sea creature is barely visible
through a strange bubble-like barrier. A faintly lit chamber lies off to
the east, its walls glowing dimly through the murky green water. Muffled
chatter can be heard from some unknown source, echoing off the walls.

A Large Meeting Chamber
    Set apart from the rest of the temple is this small, secretive meeting
chamber where the sahuagin gather to conspire. Stagnant green water fills
the room with a thick and murky cloud of filth. The southern and eastern
walls are made of ancient stones that have been piled high, whereas the
northern wall consists of a solid mass of white coral. The chamber is lit
by small glowing orbs that are suspended in the water, tethered to the
stone floor by long vine-like plants growing out of cracks between the
crumbling stones. The dim lights sway with the currents, casting dancing
shadows that skip across the grimy stone walls.

A Large Meeting Chamber
    Set apart from the rest of the temple is this small, secretive meeting
chamber where the sahuagin gather to conspire. Stagnant green water fills
the room with a thick and murky cloud of filth. The southern and eastern
walls are made of ancient stones that have been piled high, whereas the
northern wall consists of a solid mass of white coral. The chamber is lit
by small glowing orbs that are suspended in the water, tethered to the
stone floor by long vine-like plants growing out of cracks between the
crumbling stones. The dim lights sway with the currents, casting dancing
shadows that skip across the grimy stone walls.

clean water gently flows in through the tiny holes in the coral. West from
here, the faint outline of some gigantic sea creature is barely visible
through a strange bubble-like barrier. A faintly lit chamber lies off to

    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,

A Strange Coral Tunnel
    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

A Strange Coral Tunnel
    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Settlement
    At the intersection of the wide coral tunnels lays the center of the
sahuagin settlement. This chamber is quite large, tantamount to the great
square of Kalaman, only underwater. A large statue of an striking shark
stands at the center of the chamber, its vicious jaws open wide and ready
to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement
extends in all directions except for north, where the coral tunnels ends
abruptly at an underwater cliff.

The Sahuagin Settlement
    This part of the natural coral tunnel is smooth and uncluttered. The
home of the leader of this sahuagin settlement must live nearby and dislike
disturbances. The canopy of elkhorn coral above is densely packed, but still
leaves enough room for small slivers of light to filter through though even
during the day. Since there is never enough light from above, the sahuagin
have affixed a crude glass lantern to the coral growing on the southern wall.
The intersection of tunnels lies back to the west while the water becomes
chillier to the east. A large coral cave branches off to the north.

Whatever killed the coral polyps must have been strong and versatile. None

A Tunnel Through Solid Coral
    There is no canopy of elkhorn coral fingers here. Instead, the tunnel
has been bored through a solid mass of coral. Deep scratches left by the
jagged tools of the sahuagin mar the surface of the surrounding coral. In
fact, their workmanship is so poor that large chunks have been knocked
out of the walls as well. To the west, the coral tunnel opens up on the
outskirts of an underwater settlement. Below, the ragged tunnel narrows
considerably, forcing the sahuagin to pass through one after another.

it turns towards the east. The massive coral formations surrounding this
tunnel lean in, creating a passage that would frighten anyone afflicted

to swim through at a time, though the exit to the east has collapsed. A
cold current filters in through cracks in the rubble blocking the exit,

the tunnel walls providing some welcome color at these otherwise cold and

withstand the pressure may have once inhabited the coral, but they seem to
have moved on to more temperate depths. Shifts in the patterns of stones

The Base of an Underwater Cliff
    The chilly water near the ocean floor is pitch black, and it is almost
perfectly still down here. It is difficult to see very far in this strange
environment, and the pressure down here is almost crushing. Surprisingly,
an abundant array of sea life flourishes on the rocky surface of the ocean
floor. The impenetrably dark waters continue in all directions except west
where a vertical stone cliff rises out of the ocean floor.

    This dark cave lies hidden in the depths of the chilly ocean, although
its entrance appears to be well traveled. Strange shadows dance across the
uneven surface of the stone walls, obscuring the actual size of the cave.
The stone walls are covered with thousands of scratches left by the claws
of some sort of humanoid creature. Revolting bits of half-eaten flesh hang
suspended in the water, and the source of the gruesome detritus appears to
lie somewhere to the west of here, deeper within the underwater cave.

    This chamber has been laboriously carved out of the surrounding stone
by some sort of creature with massive claws. The work is quite crude, but
appears to have been done fairly efficiently. Soft beds of sea grass cover
the roughly hewn floor, and they look quite comfortable. A large weapons
rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin hangs from the southern wall, but

below, a gigantic hole has been bored through the bedrock, creating a deep
cylindrical shaft that leads into an enormous underwater city. Traced into
the stone around the rim of the opening are a series of strange runes.

The Central Shaft of Blood Shoal
    The stone wall circling the central shaft of this underwater city is
perfectly smooth, a lasting testament to the abilities of the civilization
that bored through the solid bedrock. A series of ancient runes runs along
the surface of the stone wall in a spiral that gradually descends towards
the bottom of the shaft. The ancient runes glow brightly, bathing the area
with an eerie red light. A number of round openings in the walls provide
access to tunnels that lead into different parts of the ancient city.

The Central Shaft of Blood Shoal
    The stone wall circling the central shaft of this underwater city is
perfectly smooth, a lasting testament to the abilities of the civilization
that bored through the solid bedrock. A series of ancient runes runs along
the surface of the stone wall in a spiral that gradually descends towards
the bottom of the shaft. The ancient runes glow brightly, bathing the area
with an eerie red light. A number of round openings in the walls provide
access to tunnels that lead into different parts of the ancient city.

perfectly smooth, a lasting testament to the abilities of the civilization
that bored through the solid bedrock. A series of ancient runes runs along
the surface of the stone wall in a spiral that gradually descends towards
the bottom of the shaft. The ancient runes glow brightly, bathing the area
with an eerie red light. A number of round openings in the walls provide
access to tunnels that lead into different parts of the ancient city.

The Hippocampus Stables
    These underwater stables for housing hippocampi stink of fresh manure,
just like their land-bound cousins. Unfortunately, since filth travels more
easily in water than in air, you can taste the foulness too. The source of
the onerous taint is obviously the huge pile of dung in the corner. Towards
the back of the stables are some small stalls where the hippocampi are kept
when they are not being ridden. Bridles and harnesses hang from pegs on the
western wall, above the large rolls of soft kelp which must be what all the
hippocampi are fed. The rest of the city lies south, beyond an archway.

The Central Shaft of Blood Shoal
    The stone wall circling the central shaft of this underwater city is
perfectly smooth, a lasting testament to the abilities of the civilization
that bored through the solid bedrock. A series of ancient runes runs along
the surface of the stone wall in a spiral that gradually descends towards
the bottom of the shaft. The ancient runes glow brightly, bathing the area
in an eerie red light. Three dark silver gates have been mounted into the
stone walls, restricting access to the nearby underwater palaces.

        'You must know this already since you look like one who has
    already seen much of Krynn. Perhaps you can help me with a small,
    personal matter. I have spent many years searching for ancient
    artifacts, and I am especially fond of rare swords. There is a

An Expansive Stone Chamber
    This enormous chamber appears to be used as both sleeping quarters and
a training room. A massive bed of dark sea grass stands next to the western
wall, and few eelhide scrolls sit in a pile on a small table next to it. On
the opposite side of the chamber, some concentric circles have been painted
on the floor near the training dummies tethered to the eastern wall. A huge
weapons rack made of dolphin bones is prominently mounted on the northern
wall. To the south lies a stone antechamber lined with large mosaics.

mosaics depicting sea elves speaking with representatives from some of the
other undersea races. A few dolphin bone chairs of various sizes stand near

that one is filled with air. The palace continues to the north, while there
is a dark silver gate in the southern wall that leads back to the city.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The spirit of an ancient sahuagin warleader floats here.
The spirit of a sahuagin sentry is hovering here.
