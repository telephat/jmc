   Arctic celebrated the new year with the first tournament of the wipe.
The style was a six man free-for-all, which consisted of eight preliminary
heats and then two championship rounds of the heat winners to determine
the overall champion.

   While some hiccups took place over the course of the six hour
tournament, the heats were generally successful and exciting. 20,000 coins
were awarded to each heat finalist and 2,000 coins were awarded for each
kill made in the tournament.

   Out of the eight heats rose eight finalists: Kamile, Niffy, Kamile,
Dralan, Tarialen, Sadi, Simone, Omi, and Jenni.

   These eight finalists competed in two rounds of true deathmatch
fighting, with death costing the players rank experience. In the first
round Jenni looked to be in control--surviving the longest and maintaining
the highest number of kills.

   The single person to place a bet on Jenni, though, must've celebrated
prematurely. In the second round Jenni fell off the podium as Tarialen
proved himself to be stronger in his consistency.

   Tarialen took the most kills award with 7 kills--Jenni had 4 and Simone
had 2--and the best survivor award (2nd to last and last) with honorable
mentions for Omi and Jenni. This performance clearly distinguished
Tarialen as the tournament champion, and he was rewarded generously for
this achievement. Don't ask.

   Thanks to everyone for participating, I hope you all had fun, even if
you didn't win or get to be in a heat. This tournament never could've
happened without the help of Earli, Loopley, and Bakr.

                                   Happy New Years,
                                   Terk

Fyit the rank merchant has reopened his shop.

    The costs on every purchase have been redone. The rank point costs have
changed on some items, but not most of them. The coin costs on everything
have been vastly reduced.

Enjoy,

October 25th, 2005

-The spells 'stone skin', 'prismatic spray', 'power word stun' and 'globe
 of invulnerability' have been exempted from the sheaf system. This means
 when a mage or druid dies and drops a sheaf these spells will not be lost.
-The fade skill will now be affected by the SPIN flag, previously it was not.
-A few bugs with volley have been fixed.

Enjoy,

Short Version:

Phred out. Hoss in.

Long version:

    With real life (a woman) really distracting him, Phred (possibly not a
woman) has decided to take a backseat and no longer be head of creation. I
have promoted Hoss (a woman trapped in the body of a 12 year old boy) to be
head of creation. Phred has been retired but only for the time being, he
may yet grow a pair and return to do some work and lose the retired flag.
Only time will tell.

The Good News:

-The percentage of spells lost on death by mages and druids was reduced to
 10%.
-Thief Skill 'dodge' has been made into a passive skill.

 Dodge Details:
    All players and mobs will now have a % chance to dodge a melee attack
from the mob or player they are directly attacking. This chance is based
off your DEX and a % modifier based on guild (thieves get the highest). The
