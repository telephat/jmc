Scout Rebalancing Effort (SBE):
-Fence nerfed slightly.
-Evade had a penalty added when the evader is in melee combat.
-Haste will not work on instinct commands now.
-Damaging Instinct commands had thier damage reduced slightly.
-Zap will be a little harder to land.

Other Stuff:
-The bug with studying a sheaf that isn't yours was fixed.
-Unbalance should land on a lot momre mobs now. There was a barrier to it
 working on a vast majority of the high level mobs in the game and that
 barrier was smashed to bits.

Enjoy,

Scout Rebalancing Effort (SBE):
-Fence nerfed slightly.
-Evade had a penalty added when the evader is in melee combat.
-Haste will not work on instinct commands now.
-Damaging Instinct commands had thier damage reduced slightly.
-Zap will be a little harder to land.

Other Stuff:
-The bug with studying a sheaf that isn't yours was fixed.
-Unbalance should land on a lot momre mobs now. There was a barrier to it
 working on a vast majority of the high level mobs in the game and that
 barrier was smashed to bits.

Enjoy,
