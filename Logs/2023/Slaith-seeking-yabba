    You find yourself hugging the sides of these high mountains. The air is
very thin, causing you to slow your pace to prevent from over exerting
yourself and passing out. Good idea, because that first step over the edge
is a doozy. The trail goes only north.

SLAITH SWAMP
============

BACKGROUND:

Once inhabited by civilized humans, the region known as Slaith Swamp was
abandoned long ago and has been reclaimed by nature. It is now primarily
inhabited by primitive beings who respect the food chain more than they do
the rule of law.

Much of the humid swamp is a maze of bog lands making it quite treacherous
to travel through. Several troops of explorers have attempted to map the
region in recent years but few have returned, and those who did return told
nightmarish stories about being hunted down by packs of carnivorous gnolls.

More recently there have been reports from traders traveling through the
region that a black dragon has been sighted flying over the swamp, although
whether there is any truth to these claims remains unknown.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The outer swamps contain many predators but could be explored by a group of
mid-level adventurers [20-25]. Tracking down the gnoll menace plaguing the
area would require a stronger group of seasoned warriors [25+] to ensure
the hunters do not become the hunted.

Debunking the rumors of there being dragons in the area should be left to
only those of stout heart [29+] in case the rumors turn out to be true.

LOCATION:

The swamp is east of Solace, not far off the road known as Sageway West.

Atop a Huge Mound of Garbage
    Rotting refuse, animal remains and decaying plant matter have been
heaped into this enormous mound of garbage. The heavy humidity and flooding
have saturated the garbage with water and accelerated its rate of decay,
making it particularly smelly. The area is effectively the perfect paradise
for rodents and tiny insects which swarm all over, happily gorging
themselves on putrid filth. Large plumes of steam rise upwards from the
warm garbage towards the sky, but are quickly dispersed by the wind which
whips through the open air overhead.

DRACONIAN TOWER
===============

BACKGROUND:

Recent news leaked from the Solamnic Armies indicates a major skirmish
between the knights and a convoy of draconians.  Rumors have it that the
draconians are of a newer and deadlier breed of extraordinary skill and
magical power.  It is said the handful of magical draconians are being
transported to Sanction where Highlord Ariakas will personally test their
powers.  Unconfirmed reports state that a powerful wizard of the
Dragonarmies has set up a tower as laboratory for his strange draconian
experiments.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

From the reports, this new breed of draconians are indeed extraordinarily
skilled and powerful. Only a party of strong training and skills [22+]
should attempt to seek out and destroy this operation.

LOCATION:

No one knows for certain exactly where the convoy originated, except that
it was intercepted somewhere in the Sirrion Sea.

DARK KNIGHTS OUTPOST
====================
 
BACKGROUND:
 
With the power of his dark knighthood steadily growing, Lord Ariakan has 
turned his attention from recruitment to his quest to conquer Ansalon. 
Knights dressed in the black plate of the Knighthood have been seen all 
over the continent recently, mostly in the mountains south of Palanthas.  It 
is rumored that Ariakan is collecting information, planning his attack, and 
that he will strike first at Palanthas, and an abundance of evil dragons 
being seen at night flying over the mountains supports that rumor.
 
RECOMMENDED LEVELS:
 
Little about the Knights of Takhisis is known, but from the limited 
information gathered on them, it is believed that the strength of the Dark 
Queen's Knighthood is immense. Experienced adventurers [25+] should be able 
to defend themselves against the Knights, unless hopelessly outnumbered.
 
LOCATION:
 
The mountains south of Palanthas are fairly desolate and dead. Many of the 
citizens of the fair city convince themselves that nothing would want to 
survive there, but sightings of the evil dragons flying into the range have 
started rumors that demand investigation.
