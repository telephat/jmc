The weird hisses:
    Six men raced their horses along the plains of dust. There were no
ties. Seman did not come in first. Johtham was neither first or last.
Goesan came in one place after William. Yaroi was not second. Wallin was
two places behind Seman. Who came in fourth?

The weird says 'Speak the answer outloud!'

1 Yaroi
2 Seman
3 Johtham
4 Wallin
5 William
6 Goesam
