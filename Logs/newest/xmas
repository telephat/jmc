You climb into a massive gnomish hot air balloon, giddy with excitement.
Several members of the gnomish aircrew guide you to a comfortable leather
chair where you sit back, and relax.

A moment later, a few shouts echo about and you feel your stomach jump as
the hot air balloon lifts off the ground. Slowly but surely the temperature
plummets as you float up into the clouds.

Frigid winds whistle about throughout your journey, however it is mostly
smooth sailing. After quite some time you feel the hot air balloon descend,
before it eventually touches down atop a large plateau on a frozen
mountainside.

A member of the gnomish air crew ushers you towards the exit and you
disembark, having arrived at your destination.

You climb into a massive gnomish hot air balloon, giddy with excitement.
Several members of the gnomish aircrew guide you to a comfortable leather
chair where you sit back, and relax.

A moment later, a few shouts echo about and you feel your stomach jump as
the hot air balloon lifts off the ground. Slowly but surely the temperature
plummets as you float up into the clouds.

Frigid winds whistle about throughout your journey, however it is mostly
smooth sailing. After quite some time you feel the hot air balloon descend,
before it eventually touches down atop a large plateau on a frozen
mountainside.

A member of the gnomish air crew ushers you towards the exit and you
disembark, having arrived at your destination.

some unknown means to form a giant steel building nestled amongst the rocks
of the frozen mountainside. The surface of the building is covered with
slick ice which has built up over countless years and it is completely free
of decoration or markings. A large roller door made from long, thin sheets
of steel is set into the front of the building, offering the only obvious
access point. Scuff marks and muddy footprints are scattered around the
door, suggesting there has been a lot of activity in the area recently,
particularly as the mud hasn't frozen yet.

stench that is difficult to stomach. The round mirrors on the northern wall
have all been smashed and the stone basins which once stood nearby lie in
pieces. Nothing here is in working order anymore.

every inch of this reception area, giving it an extremely festive
appearance. Clusters of jingle bells and glass baubles dangle down from the
ceiling on long strings, and the floor has been covered in fake powder
snow. A large counter of polished vallenwood runs along the northern wall
of the area and there are several plain wooden chairs situated around the
edges of the room. There is a large doorway behind the counter which leads
deeper into the facility, and the steel roller door in the southern wall
leads back to the frigid air of the frozen mountainside.

blue schematics displaying the designs of complex toys and intricate dolls

Deafening whirring, clicking and clanking sounds reverberate through the
air as the clockwork machinery idles, though the production line does not

Inside the Control Centre
    Small flashing lights and strange machinery cover the steel panels
lining the walls of this control centre, making it quite the sight to
behold. Several large black levers jut out from the machinery intermingled
with a variety of coloured buttons, although most of them appear to have
been heavily damaged and may no longer function. Large dents, cracks and
scorch marks stain the surface of the steel panelling, and it is quite
obvious this damage was intentional and recent. The air is filled with a
loud humming sound suggesting there is some sort of arcane energy powering
the machinery, but there is no obvious power source within sight.

Inside the Control Centre
    Small flashing lights and strange machinery cover the steel panels
lining the walls of this control centre, making it quite the sight to
behold. Several large black levers jut out from the machinery intermingled
with a variety of coloured buttons, although most of them appear to have
been heavily damaged and may no longer function. Large dents, cracks and
scorch marks stain the surface of the steel panelling, and it is quite
obvious this damage was intentional and recent. The air is filled with a
loud humming sound suggesting there is some sort of arcane energy powering
the machinery, but there is no obvious power source within sight.

snow. A large counter of polished vallenwood runs along the northern wall

some unknown means to form a giant steel building nestled amongst the rocks
of the frozen mountainside. The surface of the building is covered with
slick ice which has built up over countless years and it is completely free
of decoration or markings. A large roller door made from long, thin sheets
of steel is set into the front of the building, offering the only obvious
access point. Scuff marks and muddy footprints are scattered around the
door, suggesting there has been a lot of activity in the area recently,

This expansive plateau has formed half-way up an enormous, snow-covered

towards a large building which looms in the distance.

Inside the Control Centre
    Small flashing lights and strange machinery cover the steel panels
lining the walls of this control centre, making it quite the sight to
behold. Several large black levers jut out from the machinery intermingled
with a variety of coloured buttons, although most of them appear to have
been heavily damaged and may no longer function. Large dents, cracks and
scorch marks stain the surface of the steel panelling, and it is quite
obvious this damage was intentional and recent. The air is filled with a
loud humming sound suggesting there is some sort of arcane energy powering
the machinery, but there is no obvious power source within sight.

On the Production Line
    Dozens of long, mechanical arms reach down from the high ceiling of
this expansive production environment, arranged through a wondrous feat of
engineering to form a clockwork-powered assembly line. Masses of thick
brass pipes, steel cogs and strange gizmos are embedded into the ceiling
and walls, most likely as part of powering the production equipment. Large
blue schematics displaying the designs of complex toys and intricate dolls
are stuck to the walls, although a few have been ripped down recently.

the ground, suggesting the factory workers, who are nowhere to be seen, may

    Towering sets of broad steel shelves are lined up in parallel rows
throughout this expansive warehouse, rising all the way up to the ceiling

this place feel extremely empty. Fine dust particles flutter about in the
air after being kicked up by recent activity and an uncountable number of
muddy boot prints are caked onto the floor. Everywhere looks the same in
this enormous warehouse making it quite difficult to navigate without

    Stretching across most of the room, a massive net made from springy
rubber acts as a collection tool to collect things that fall from above.
The net is stretched at an angle, making anything which lands in it
naturally tumble to the ground, albeit in a much gentler fashion than if
there was no net at all. Old, crushed boxes and smashed toys lie along the
edges of the room and behind the net, marking them as the unfortunate gifts
that missed the target. A rectangular tunnel in the western wall leads out
of the catchment area into an expansive warehouse filled with shelves.

A Distribution Preparation Facility
    Most of this room is relatively clear, free of furniture or equipment
which might obstruct any movement of merchandise as it is brought here from
the warehouse. Countless thick sacks of stitched brown leather hang off
giant steel hooks fixed to the walls, each ready to be filled with presents
before being transported to one of the cities of Krynn for distribution. An
enormous arrow has been painted onto the floor in bright yellow paint which
points eastward into the wide hallway that leads away from this area.

A Hallway Filled with Dormant Portals
    Dark shadows loom over everything in this long hallway making it
difficult to see very far. Large archways constructed from rune-etched
cobalt stand along both walls, each of which has a small plaque embedded
into the floor in front of it. The plaques each have the name of cities
inscribed into them, marking them as transportation portals which are
probably used for toy distribution. There does not appear to be any energy
or power passing through the archways currently, and as a result they stand
dormant. The angular hallway continues to extend into the darkness to the
east, while a larger open area is visible through the opening to the west.

A Hallway Filled with Dormant Portals
    Dark shadows loom over everything in this long hallway making it
difficult to see very far. Large archways constructed from rune-etched
cobalt stand along both walls, each of which has a small plaque embedded
into the floor in front of it. The plaques each have the name of cities
inscribed into them, marking them as transportation portals which are
probably used for toy distribution. There does not appear to be any energy
or power passing through the archways currently, and as a result they stand
dormant. Solid steel doors stand at the eastern end of the hallway and look
strong enough to withstand a beating from a mountain giant.

A Stairway Covered with Ice
    Fixed to the side of the production facility, this wide set of steel
stairs hang over thin air. The view from here is spectacular, providing
unobstructed vision of the frozen mountain range in all directions as far
as the eye can see. There is nothing but air below and steel railings run
alongside the stairs to prevent falling. Thick layers of ice have
accumulated on the steps over time as a result of the cold temperature|
however, they still have sufficient texture to prevent them becoming
slippery. A large set of steel doors at the base of the stairway leads back
into the facility, while the stairs lead upwards towards a landing zone set
up on the rooftop of the building.

On a Frozen Landing 
    Situated on top of the production facility, this flat platform is the
perfect location for flying creatures or vehicles to land. A massive,
bright yellow circle has been painted onto the centre of the platform which
has a giant black 'S' in the middle. Large mounds of snow have been pushed
up against the area and form a makeshift boundary, preventing anyone from
accidently wandering off the edge. Several small mechanical lanterns are
fused onto the platform around the yellow circle and flicker softly, which
when viewed from the sky would create a visual marker for anything
approaching from up above. The only ways off the platform are the icy
stairwell or flight, unless you fancy the fast way down the mountain.

    Situated on top of the production facility, this flat platform is the
perfect location for flying creatures or vehicles to land. A massive,
bright yellow circle has been painted onto the centre of the platform which
has a giant black 'S' in the middle. Large mounds of snow have been pushed
up against the area and form a makeshift boundary, preventing anyone from
accidently wandering off the edge. Several small mechanical lanterns are
fused onto the platform around the yellow circle and flicker softly, which
when viewed from the sky would create a visual marker for anything
approaching from up above. The only ways off the platform are the icy
stairwell or flight, unless you fancy the fast way down the mountain.

A Stairway Covered with Ice
    Fixed to the side of the production facility, this wide set of steel
stairs hang over thin air. The view from here is spectacular, providing
unobstructed vision of the frozen mountain range in all directions as far
as the eye can see. There is nothing but air below and steel railings run
alongside the stairs to prevent falling. Thick layers of ice have
accumulated on the steps over time as a result of the cold temperature|
however, they still have sufficient texture to prevent them becoming
slippery. A large set of steel doors at the base of the stairway leads back
into the facility, while the stairs lead upwards towards a landing zone set
up on the rooftop of the building.

A Hallway Filled with Dormant Portals
    Dark shadows loom over everything in this long hallway making it
difficult to see very far. Large archways constructed from rune-etched
cobalt stand along both walls, each of which has a small plaque embedded
into the floor in front of it. The plaques each have the name of cities
inscribed into them, marking them as transportation portals which are
probably used for toy distribution. There does not appear to be any energy
or power passing through the archways currently, and as a result they stand
dormant. Solid steel doors stand at the eastern end of the hallway and look
strong enough to withstand a beating from a mountain giant.

giant steel hooks fixed to the walls, each ready to be filled with presents
before being transported to one of the cities of Krynn for distribution. An

points eastward into the wide hallway that leads away from this area.

of decoration or markings. A large roller door made from long, thin sheets
of steel is set into the front of the building, offering the only obvious
access point. Scuff marks and muddy footprints are scattered around the
door, suggesting there has been a lot of activity in the area recently,

On the Production Line
    Dozens of long, mechanical arms reach down from the high ceiling of
this expansive production environment, arranged through a wondrous feat of
engineering to form a clockwork-powered assembly line. Masses of thick
brass pipes, steel cogs and strange gizmos are embedded into the ceiling

    Small flashing lights and strange machinery cover the steel panels
lining the walls of this control centre, making it quite the sight to
behold. Several large black levers jut out from the machinery intermingled
with a variety of coloured buttons, although most of them appear to have
been heavily damaged and may no longer function. Large dents, cracks and
scorch marks stain the surface of the steel panelling, and it is quite
obvious this damage was intentional and recent. The air is filled with a
loud humming sound suggesting there is some sort of arcane energy powering
the machinery, but there is no obvious power source within sight.

A Heavily Decorated Reception

snow. A large counter of polished vallenwood runs along the northern wall

A Disgusting Bathroom
    Large clods of thick mud have melted onto the floor and most of the
toilets have been violently destroyed, left to slowly leak excrement
everywhere. These two nasty substances have then merged together to form a
layer of smelly brown sludge which has filled the room with a horrific
stench that is difficult to stomach. The round mirrors on the northern wall
have all been smashed and the stone basins which once stood nearby lie in
pieces. Nothing here is in working order anymore.

Outside a Giant Steel Building
    Thick slabs of solid steel have been magnificently fused together by
some unknown means to form a giant steel building nestled amongst the rocks
of the frozen mountainside. The surface of the building is covered with
slick ice which has built up over countless years and it is completely free
of decoration or markings. A large roller door made from long, thin sheets
of steel is set into the front of the building, offering the only obvious
access point. Scuff marks and muddy footprints are scattered around the
door, suggesting there has been a lot of activity in the area recently,
particularly as the mud hasn't frozen yet.

A Plateau on a Frozen Mountain
    Frigid winds blast along the icy surface of this rocky plateau,
threatening to freeze anything that lingers here too long. The chilling
temperature is almost unbearable, although the beautiful views of the
surrounding frozen mountains do help make things slightly more bearable.
This expansive plateau has formed half-way up an enormous, snow-covered
mountain, making it the perfect place for flying vehicles to land so their
passengers can disembark. A thin, icy path leads through the craggy rocks
towards a large building which looms in the distance.

Several members of the gnomish aircrew guide you to a comfortable leather
chair where you sit back, and relax.

A moment later, a few shouts echo about and you feel your stomach jump as
the hot air balloon lifts off the ground. Slowly but surely the temperature
plummets as you float up into the clouds.

Frigid winds whistle about throughout your journey, however it is mostly
smooth sailing. After quite some time you feel the hot air balloon descend,
before it eventually touches down in the middle of a grassy field.
