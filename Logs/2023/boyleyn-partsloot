an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a

an equilateral triangle. The stony corridor is long and narrow, so any

Here the walls surrounding you are certainly not manmade, as they are
irregular as well as smooth, probably crafted from erosion a long time ago.

An Arena
    You find yourself now in a flat open area, with tall stone walls
blocking your exits to the north and east. The walls and floor are both
crudely 'carved', though they look more as if they were pushed back by a
huge magical wall of force. A more recent addition to the walls, red stains
that look very much like dried blood are on the lower parts of the wall and
the floor.
A purple automaton is here and ready to assist its creator.
The spirit of a fallen sahuagin warrior floats here.
The spirit of a senior sahuagin battle priestess is hovering here.
The spirit of an ancient sahuagin warleader floats here.
The spirit of Xolotl the High Priestess is hovering here.
You sense a life form.

l automaton
The automaton is made purely of purple hued metal. Powerful metal legs
support the box-like torso which has a single arm protruding from it. On
the back of the torso is a large switch, probably there to activate some
secondary function of the automaton.
A purple automaton is in an excellent condition.

activate automaton
You flick the switch on the torso of the automaton. Its arm whirs to life,
as the hand is retracted within and replaced by a steel drill. It looks
prepared to dig somewhere.
The purple automaton directs the drill on its arm towards the red X on the
eastern wall. After a few moments, a narrow passage has been cut from the
stone face.

A Hidden Store Room
    A small alcove within the stone walls of the arena, this is a stockpile
of equipment and weapons, most likely Boyelin's most valued experiments.
The room is cramped and large enough to fit perhaps an automaton and a
gnome, and no more.
A dagger with a doublet of blades is resting on the ground...it glows dimly
A sword with a long green blade attracts you with its glow...it glows dimly..it hums softly
A composite bow constructed of metal lies here, waiting to be employed...it glows dimly..it hums softly
The head of a very large battle axe shimmers as light passes over it...it hums softly
A chain of metal composed of nine sections is curled around itself.
A sword with a helical blade lies here silent...it glows dimly
Some unintelligible papers on a mechanical creation lie here in a pile.

These papers detail the construction of a mechanical behemoth that looks
very much like a dragon. You can't understand exactly what it means, but
someone who could would probably love to get their hands on these.
