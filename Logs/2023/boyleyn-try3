An Unkempt Path
    The dirt path underfoot creates a small clouds of dust whenever it's
stepped upon. Nevertheless, the lack of footprints and untouched greenery
along side the path makes it look like the path hasn't been tread much
recently. Just to the north a small stone building can be seen. The path
continues back off to the east.

A Cluttered Laboratory
    Within the confines of the small stone building is a very messy and
disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or
at least a kender) lived here, as various knick-knacks and half-finished
inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall. No one seems to be
occupying the lab at the moment.
A rock golem stalwartly stands here.
A rock golem gives you a solid punch in the face.

bit when stepped upon. The air's a bit dry. The surrounding earth and stone
walls and ceiling are lined with wooden beams and supports. The walkway

breaths to compensate. The walkway continues to the north and south.

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.
A large multicolored portal hovers near one wall of the room...it glows dimly

The Bank of Dawnguard
    A polished wooden counter hangs on the west side of the area. Behind it,
a mechanical accountant, obviously purchased from the gnomes of Mount
Nevermind, sorts through coins and financial documents. It seems readily
capable of handling both withdrawals from and deposits into the gleaming
steel safe, tucked along the western wall.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
The clan blacksmith is standing here.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The torso section of a purple automaton is here.
A wooden key with two colors is sitting here.
A potion is lying here. [4]
A mystic key lies here.
A fanged human skull.
You sense a life form.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.
