Of cource I mostly hung to the shadows and I found a bag of gold near a
draconian general.  I went to get the bag to make sure he didn't leave it
lying there.  As I was picking it up, he suddenly looks down at me.  He
thought I was going to steal it.  I mean I may have borrowed it for a little
bit, but I would have returned it to him in time.  I know how humans get
about their belongings.  Unfortunately, he didn't believe in my good
intentions.  I was lucky I was quicker than him and a few of his gnoll friends.
He had me so frustrated that I didn't realize that i still had the gold
in my hands.  I was going to wait for him to calm down before I tried to
return it but I decided to leave Neraka for the time.  Maybe I will meet
him again in the future.'

=================

BACKGROUND:

The town of Lemish was once a thriving center of trade.  The capital city
of the nation of the same name, Lemish has a long history.  However, Lemish
was recently captured by the dragonarmies and now serves as a key center
for recruiting new soldiers.  The old mayor has been replaced by a
mysterious new one and all diplomatic ties to the other nations of Solamnia
have been severed.  The dwarven nation of Garnet seeks to end the
dragonarmy's control of this town and liberate the land of evil.  Unlike
most dwarves, the Garnet dwarves are taking an active role in ridding the
world of evil.  Sadly, they are at a standstill with Lemish right now.  A
strange veil of evil has covered the Darkwoods, the forest separating the
two nations.  Unable to probe into the forest, the dwarves now are held up
in their mountain city.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Both Lemish and Garnet contain challenges high level groups of [18+] to
try to unlock the secrets of the areas.

 [return for more, q to stop]
LOCATION:

Lemish is located to the west of the Khalkist mountains in lower Solamnia.
The continent's highway system leads through the city, making it easy to
find.  Garnet is nestled in the Garnet Mountains, a large mountain range
capped with snow.  The Garnet Mountains are located to the west of the
Darkwoods.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,

Binding is for the sole use of a developing scout. If the scout encounters
an ethereal spirit creature of its path (HELP PATH), it can bind the
spirit to its soul. Two scenarios will result in failure. First, if the
spirit's instinct is beyond the scope of your power, you will be unable to
adopt it into your soul. Second, if you have the power to obtain the
spirit, but are missing the primary depth of the same circle, the spirit
will resist your advances.
