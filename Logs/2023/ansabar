he spe globe
Spell    : Globe of Invulnerability
Sphere   : Abjuration
Usage    : cast 'globe of invulnerability' [caster only]
Duration : level/2 hours
Effects  : Reduces physical damage

A globe of force springs into being around the caster, reducing damage he
receives. The globe gives no protection from enchantments which do not do
damage. Note that the globe draws its power from the caster's life energy
and therefore will inhibit recuperation to some extent.

Details:
- Defensive spell which grants LIMIT_DAMAGE and IMMUNE_CRITICALS.
- Heavily reduces the caster's REGEN_FACTOR.

Component Casting:
--Increased duration.
--Decreased penalty.

he spe rel
Spell    : Relocate
Sphere   : Alteration
Usage    : cast 'relocate' [char in world]
Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Caster is teleported to victim

This is similar to teleport, but is targetable. The caster will instantly
be transferred to the specified victim's location. Note that you can only
relocate to another adventurer, and not a monster.

Relocating to target's the caster is grouped or clanned with will always
work, but trying to relocate to an ungrouped and unclanned target only
works if the caster is working at level 28 or higher.

Details:
- Utility spell which teleports the caster directly to the victim.

Component Casting:
--Possibility to leave and arrive silently.
