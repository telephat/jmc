The Collapsing Corridor
    You walk into this dangerous-looking section of corridor and start
clambering over the fallen rocks. A large chunk of rock suddenly breaks
away under the pressure of your foot, collapsing onto the ground with a
loud crash. Moments later, an incredibly loud "crack!" from somewhere above
your head deafens you, and you realize with sudden horror that you have
triggered the collapse of the ceiling above you. Fallen obstacles hamper
your efforts to escape, and it is not long before you find your legs
trapped under fallen rubble. Amidst the cacophony of the cavern's collapse,
you cry out to the gods to have mercy, to end this swiftly. Your prayers
are answered as a large section of rock comes loose above you, smashing
into your body and crushing your skull.
