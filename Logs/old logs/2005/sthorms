growing...I am useless, my time here is nearing end...Please, warn the world
or soon the Dark Knights will conquer all...Please...

He starts coughing again, more violently now...blood flowing rapidly from his
mouth. Somehow, with his dying breath he manages to utters the words, 'Est
Sularus Oth Mithas', then his eyes close and a look of peace washes over
face.

Steel chortles loudly and says:
You expect me to feel compassion for my enemy? That man would've sooner seen me
dead than rescue me if the situations were reversed. Nothing has changed, my
loyalty still lies with Lord Ariakan. I hear they have captured a traitor...
perhaps you would like to free him too.

says:
Hiya! I'm Tironki Burrfoot, thanks for helping me out of that trap! Wow,
those skull knights are so uptight! All I did was find their pile of gold
for them, you'd think they'd thank me! I guess they don't like kender here,
I guess thats alright because I don't like this place. Ooohhh, I almost
forgot, I heard the high priestess talking about some traitor they were
gonna strap to the altar after me...What was her name? Sally? Kara? Sara!
Thats it! Well thanks for helping me out!

pouches and start after him when you notice Steel's stoic face go pale.
