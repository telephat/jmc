To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

soft voice.  You barely recall the last message to you:

     life.  I bind your soul to the mortal realm so you may
     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

Welcome to the land of Krynn.
scoeqlook
Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.

To prevent potentially offensive names and to help promote a better
role-playing environment, we reserve the right to delete or force a player
to change his name if we feel that it is inappropriate.  Character names
should be chosen in light of the world in which Dragonlance stories take
place.  However, due to identities of storybook characters and zones based
on these stories, most of the popular names (of characters and gods) in
these books have been restricted (i.e. Tanis, Goldmoon, Paladine, etc.) so
you must select a name with this in mind.  In addition, compound nouns
(such as Darkshadow or Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as
Superman or Judgedredd), and silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)
are considered quite inappropriate.  Characters with such names will very
likely deleted or changed without notice.  In the event you are asked to
change names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite
and courteous:  Staff members are here to help maintain a proper gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

     play your part in the continual struggle.  This is not

Nowhere
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

A faint voice echoes: New players should type 'help newbie' and 'topics'.
You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name. Valid starting points are:
    SOLACE    HAVEN    TARSIS    BALIFOR    KALAMAN    PALANTHAS

to begin a new life of adventure within the lands of Ansalon.  You have
no time to view the landscape as more than a blurred blob before you find
yourself at your new destination.
The Seeker's Inn
    A fire blazes in a large stone fireplace in the northern corner of
the room. Several tables are scattered around, and several occupants of
the inn are seated at the tables, ordering food and drink from the roving
waitresses. A bard sits by the fireplace, a lute slung over one shoulder.
