A Mountain Trail
    A large tree rooted to the side of the trail threatens to tumble down
the mountain side into the ogre village below. The trail here, while
mountainous, is relatively flat and straight, but to the north it clearly
becomes a much more difficult journey. Of course, the trail also leads east
toward the gates of the dwarven keep.

On a Precariously Rooted Tree
    This tree is remarkably sturdy, considering it is growing out of the
mountain horizontally. It has many branches that look capable of supporting
a good deal of weight. Far to the north you see a cave opening down the
side of the mountain, but it is way too far to jump to from here. Crawling
along the tree back to the mountain should be easy.

Inside a Cave
    A thin layer of soil and moss clings to this cave, carpeting the walls
and ground with dark greens and browns. Gently sloping towards a sheer
dropoff a few paces to your north, the rough floor suggests hidden layers
of rock and dirt that have fallen in from the mountain above. Dank musty
air emanates from deeper within the cavern, filling your mind with images
of fungi and stagnant water. You struggle to maintain balance as your feet
settle into the dirt and lichen.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The General Store of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.
A grinning and grey-haired man invites potential shoppers to his stall.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

the room with an ambient hum. Veins of limestone and quartz split open in
gashlike formations up and down the walls. Fungus covers much of the walls
in broad circular formations, light fuzzy moss filling the gaps.. at least
you think it's moss. While the shaft seems to have once led to the south,
passage now has been blocked off by a cave-in of hundreds of tons of rock.

    Cold stone walls close in on you from all sides - at many points this

Thick brown moss grows like so many eyebrows around the room. The cavern

it self in many places. The south side drops off into a gigantic shaft, the
opening lined with a thick mineral crusted stone ring.

worn down to the east by the constantly crashing river. Soft flecks of grey
moss are scattered out on the smooth stone, seemingly drawing in the light

A Crystal Lined Tunnel
    Granite walls expose long veins and gashes of crystal everywhere,
becoming more crystal than granite to the east. The floor and walls are
piled with rubble, likely from the granite crumbling off of the crystalline
innards of this cavern. To the east, an extremely expansive cavern opens
up, glimmering and reflecting more light than it receives.

An Unbearable Acid Pit
    Tears form in your eyes, making it difficult to see clearly. Several
oval-shaped crevices line the walls of this cavern, filled with some sort
of bubbling acid, all feeding into smaller streamlets. The streamlets all
connect to a much larger pit of acid in the center of the room. A peculiar
crater-shaped hole in one corner of the cave has a smooth rim.
A large churning pit of yellow acid sits in the center of the room.
A young black dragon stands ready to strike.

As you enter the room, the dragon looks up from his meal of a dwarven
miner. He sees you still have all the meat on your bones, slurps up the
rest of the dwarf and spits the bones into the acid pit in the center of
the room. The acid pit quickly disintigrates the rest of the dwarf... and
the dragon turns towards you!

A Crystal Grotto
    You stand facing your reflection in a long crystalline wall, embedded
with ragged chunks of quartz and limestone protruding at various heights.
The crystal bends light through itself multiple times, causing several
multicolored bands to shine through the surface. The floor is littered with
small rocks and raw chunks of quartz, causing you to stub your toes
whenever you move around.

Rough End of a Crystal Grotto
    Crystal and rock meld together along the north wall and across the

Along the base of the boulders small and large cave mushrooms grow in odd
shaped rings. A slimy coating of calcium enriched water covers the surface
of all the stone, although it doesn't appear to stick to the crystal. The
caverns ceiling lies shrouded in shadows and crystals.

Gradually Sloping Tunnel
    You are forced to crawl on your belly in order to maneuver in this
small sloping tunnel formed from jagged limestone slabs. A few broken
stalagmites and stalactites cling to the tunnel, almost as if they were
broken off by other creatures travelling through. The limestone has
smudgemarks on it, and much of the orange and green fungus looks like it
has been chewed on by sharp teeth.

Dark Tunnel Through a Bakali Encampment
    Dark stained limestone walls, with many hundreds of scratches, line
this cavernous tunnel. Small side tunnels seem to lead off in all
directions, as far as you can see and it is difficult to move without
stepping in a clawed footprint. Several odd shaped piles of stones are
stacked near the front of each side tunnel, with chewed up bits of moss and
fungus protruding at odd angles.

this cavernous tunnel. Small side tunnels seem to lead off in all

stepping in a clawed footprint. Several odd shaped piles of stones are
stacked near the front of each side tunnel, with chewed up bits of moss and
fungus protruding at odd angles.

An Abrasive Corner in a Dark Tunnel

a shallow spiral pattern has been cut into the stone on the floor on the

A Dank Tunnel
    Huge stalactites have been chopped off and lined up along the north
wall, strangely beautiful with reddish hued mineral rings. A cloud of moist
air hangs heavy in the cave, and small droplets of water form on all the

untouched, although there is evidence of a lot of traffic from clawed feet
here.

has been chewed on by sharp teeth.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring

The General Store of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
