Lost in a Void Between Dimensions
    Between dimensions, reality seems to shift and warp unpredictably. For
now, strange blue sand covers the land for miles in every direction. The
air here is parched and dry, and it shimmers from the heat rising off the
blue sand. Though there is no sun, a midday light hangs in the clear sky
above. A variety of green and blue rocks dot the landscape, though none
are large enough to use as a landmark.

This young man's eyes have a wild look about them. Despite the sneering
look of contempt on his face, this he is quite handsome. His black satin
robes are covered in so much dirt and grime that he must have worn them for
quite some time. Having been here for quite some time, he may know a thing
or two about this strange place.

   "Ah, I see our host has brought some more guests to the party. Soon, I
    shall escape this place and leave weaklings such as yourself behind.
    Begone from my sight."

The hot air shimmers around you as you walk off into the distance. You
begin to sweat from the heat radiating off the blue sands, and you can feel
dehydration start to overtake you. As you blink the sweat from your eyes,
you suddenly realize you are no longer in the strange blue desert.

You stumble awkwardly through a heavy mist.

Lost in a Void Between Dimensions
    Between dimensions, reality seems to shift and warp unpredictably. For
now, jagged rocks of red and orange rise up out of a bed of lavender snow.
Like crooked fingers, they point at the ominous green sky overhead.
Occasionally, the sound of falling boulders echoes off in the distance.
Through the lavender snow, paths lead off in all directions. All of the
paths seem to wind confusingly through the forest of jagged rocks, and
there is no way to know where any of them lead.

The white robed mage looks up sadly as you approach:

   "Greetings, child. My name is Mira. I see you are trapped in this void,
    just as I am. Well, perhaps 'trapped' is too strong a word, for you
    already possess the means to escape. Unfortunately, the only way out is
    through our captor. Your magic can take you to him, but you should know
    that he is not a gentle warden.

   "A year ago, the Conclave charged my son, Dorian, with the task of
    subduing a renegade mage named Raz'Kazar. Most renegades crave power
    above all else, but Raz'Kazar is different. He is an Aurak draconian
    who left the service of his Queen to find a means of rescuing his
    people from their enslavement. In his quest, he has grown powerful
    enough for the Conclave to take notice, and they were not pleased that
    he refused to submit to their will. I suppose trading one master for
    another did not sit well with him.

   "And so my son, young and arrogant, sought to capture Raz'Kazar on his
    own. Alone, he was no match for the renegade's power. My poor, foolish
    boy was easily defeated and cast into this endless void. While he and I
    have grown apart since he chose to take the black robes, he is still my
    son. So when I went to Raz'Kazar to negotiate his release, the Aurak
    cast me into this prison with him.

   "Now, my son refuses to talk with me. He thinks I am here to talk him
    out of the path he has chosen. And yet, I know that working together,
    we could defeat Raz'Kazar and escape this place. He won't listen to me,
    but perhaps he would talk with you. Would you speak with him for me?"

The white robed mage smiles as you accept her quest:

   "Thank you, child. Here, take this box with you. I have lost the key for
    this, but my son will be able to help you open it. He will recognize
    the box and know the value of what's inside. Perhaps this gesture will
    ease the conversation."

The black robed mage looks at you suspiciously:

   "Ah, so you are to be my mother's emissary then? She was always
    bothersome, intruding on others' affairs. And now she thinks that I
    would work with the likes of you?! Well, perhaps there is some merit to
    the idea. The amulet she keeps in that box is quite powerful, and if
    you pair it with my staff, you might be able to defeat the Aurak, and
    we could all escape. Hm ... very well. Extenuating circumstances force
    my hand. I shall help you open the box."

Dorian Kinare focuses on you and utters some strange words.
Your fingers tingle with power.

As you turn to leave, he stops you for a moment:

   "Well, hm. If she trusted you enough to give you her amulet, perhaps you
    can get her to fix the staff as well. Then, you should be able to
    defeat the Aurak and set us all free. Remember, I expect you to return
    the staff when you are done with it, lest I be forced to reclaim it.
    I would enjoy that, but you would not. For now, we are allies. When you
    assault Raz'Kazar in his lair, I will join in the attack."

Dorian hands you his cracked staff.

rituals and incantations used to create draconians. The shelves on the

collection must have access to a wider range of spells than most mages.

Dressed in gray robes with a gray peaked canvas hat, this man is not
physically here. He is an astral projection of someone back on Krynn. He
reaches his arm out and beckons you closer, in hopes you will listen to
what he has to say.
An astral projection is in an excellent condition.

an astral projection is using:

The astral projections tells you:

      'I shouldn't be here, but I found it unfair the Conclave sent you
   into the astral plane with no help. This is the plane of dreams and
   imagination. It is an endless sea of gray. You can imagine almost
   anything into being. If you need help, just imagine it. If you need a
   weapon, some armor, or even an exit...just imagine them. Unfortunately,
   even if you want to leave, you'll have to take out the astral stalker.
   He's lurking around, probably guarding the portal out of here. Good
   luck, my friend.'

The astral projections tells you:

      'I shouldn't be here, but I found it unfair the Conclave sent you
   into the astral plane with no help. This is the plane of dreams and
   imagination. It is an endless sea of gray. You can imagine almost
   anything into being. If you need help, just imagine it. If you need a
   weapon, some armor, or even an exit...just imagine them. Unfortunately,
   even if you want to leave, you'll have to take out the astral stalker.
   He's lurking around, probably guarding the portal out of here. Good

Lady Ilys says 'Here in the next day or so I am expecting a visitor from Vingaard.  Would you and your wife like to have dinner with us Merrick?'

Mayor Merrick says 'True, those ravens are becoming a problem. That vallenwood tree in the park has become a breeding nightmare.'

Mayor Merrick continues 'Maybe we should hire some woodsmen to trap some of those birds.'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:2 T:33 Exits:NE> 

Old man Farley says 'Blah, those ravens shouldn't be our concern. We need to be worrying about those goblins living in the sewers.'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:54 Exits:NE> 

Mayor Merrick says 'Now now Farley, don't get worked up there. I know you don't like goblins and neither do I, but there is nothing to worry about.'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:46 Exits:NE> 

The waitress tries to slip away unnoticed.

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:37 Exits:NE> 

Mayor Merrick continues 'Those Seekers down in Haven have some guards that patrol the woods, and they would keep such foul beings away.'

Tika Waylan leaves north.

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:30 Exits:NE> 

Lady Ilys says 'Let's not talk about the Seekers. They might be okay people, but they don't worship the true gods. May Paladine enlighten them.'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:22 Exits:NE> 

Old man Farley says 'Don't try to change the subject to religion. We all know the gods are gone, but those goblins are real. What is it going to take for you to realize they are a threat?'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C Mem:1 T:14 Exits:NE> 

Mayor Merrick says 'Just shut up about goblins, I will see if I can find some adventurers brave enough to rid the sewers of the 'Farley Gobs.'

162H 131V 454857X 17.60% 800C T:57 Exits:NE> 

Lady Ilys continues 'I hear it has fallen into an awful state, and needs a lot of repairs.  If I had grand kids, I know I would be worried about them playing there.'

This young barbarian is barely out of his teenage years although he is
stoutly built with muscles rippling throughout his small frame. He is clad
in a patchwork of rabbit fur that manages to barely cover as much as is
considered decent. It is obvious that he has been training with his
weapons since adolescence by the confidence and ease with which he handles
them. With his gaze set far to the horizon, he mumbles something about
slaying a particular ancient green dragon one day.
Horan is in an excellent condition.
