ENSTAR BAY
==========

BACKGROUND:

In the southern edge of the Sirrion sea, below Southern Ergoth, lies a
mysterious bay. Few have visited the bay of Enstar, and fewer still have
returned. Those that have managed to escape the treacherous waters around
the bay tell tales of horrible undersea scraggs, lost gnomes, comatose
kender, and a great evil which knows no name. A tall tower glowers above
the rocky reach of the gulf, hiding secrets from the mortal world.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The calm waters of the bay are safe for solo low level adventurers [5-10]
when approached with care. To delve further into the depths could present
a challenge worthy of a small mid level group [15-20], while the deepest
secrets would require a significantly more experienced group.

LOCATION:

Enstar Bay lies to the southwest of Haven, far south from the elven arches
of Southern Ergoth.

TEMPLE OF GRAK
==============
 
BACKGROUND:
 
The Woods of Morgoth were at one time a place of legendary beauty in the
Plains of Solamnia. Recently, however, people have begun to disappear within
its once friendly confines.
 
It is feared that the evil cult of the god of decay and disease, Morgion has
once more inhabited an ancient temple hidden somewhere within the woods.
The woods themselves can be found just outside the west gate of the northern
city of Kalaman, deep in the Plains of Solamnia.
 
RECOMMENDED LEVELS:
 
Adventurers of lower mid-levels [6-10] in groups should be able to fully
explore the depths of the temples, and brave the undead horrors within.
 
LOCATION:
 
The woods are located to the west of the city of Kalaman, in the vast
Solamnic Plains.

CREATED BY:

Morgion

    The endlessly churning water of the River White-Rage flows to the east
with understated power. The currents flow deep and strong, making it
extremely difficult to move upstream. Small pockets of foam form as the
water swirls along the banks of the river. Overhanging the river's edge on
both the north and south sides are densely packed oak trees, the beginnings
of mighty forests.

BANDITS' HIDEOUT
================

BACKGROUND:

The towns of Solace, Haven and Newport have been trading with each other
for many years, their merchants using either the roads or the White Rage
River to transfer their goods between them on a regular basis. Although
their caravans are sometimes attacked by thieves and bandits, these
unlawful gangs have been proved quite useless against the mercenary guards
hired to protect the merchants. Recently, however, things have changed. The
bandits' numbers have been greatly increased, their targets are selected
with great care and their attacks seem to be planned and organized. More
and more valuable merchandise is lost to their attacks, and the merchants
and citizens of Newport are becoming restless, demanding that their
government protect their property and ensure safe passage to the nearby
cities.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Although the bandits' attacks seem to be based on careful planning and the
element of surprise, the mercenaries protecting the caravans have a hard
time against them whenever combat erupts. A small group of low-mid level
adventurers [9-12] might be required to put an end to this threat.

LOCATION:

The mayor of Newport has dispatched groups of soldiers to track down and
eliminate the bandits' hideout, but it is well hidden in the vast forest to
the southwest of the city, and their efforts have been fruitless so far.

You spin the pumice stone in your fingers, searching all over the porous
surface for some clue to the power locked within. Finding nothing, you
utter a scandalous curse and smash the stone upon the ground. You nearly
turn away in defeat before noticing that the small, black flecks from the
shattered stone have formed an interesting pattern - one that reveals the
spell sanctify corpse to your patient mind.

op jar
You reach towards a red clay jar, expecting something magical to happen.

As your fingers touch the clay jar's lid, you feel a malevolent presence
from within the jar reaching towards you. The spirit of a hideous spectral
guardian bound within you shivers with fear.

Suddenly, the lid bursts open, and a strange metallic mist erupts from
the jar, quickly wrapping itself around you. As you watch in horror, the
clay jar begins to grow rapidly (though perhaps it is YOU who begins to
shrink rapidly) until it is massive enough to swallow an elephant!

The metallic mist around you slowly solidifies, transforming itself into
a shimmering, reflective sphere, and the last thing you see before the
sphere's surface becomes completely opaque is the open end of the massive
clay jar turning towards you and floating forth to swallow you!

You feel less protected from undeath.

When you regain your senses, you find yourself floating among strange,

This heavy staff appears to be crafted from the thick femur bone of a black
dragon. It has been polished to a glossy finish and appears to be imbued
with a strange, supernatural magic. Small rubies, topazes and emeralds are
embedded along the length of the staff in seemingly random places, and a
large sapphire is set into the head of the bone. A mismatched collection of
runes run in a circle around the large sapphire. They appear to have been
etched by four very different hands, and their purpose is unclear.

The runes encircling the sapphire clearly spell out four separate words,
and they appear to have been etched into the bone by four very different
hands. Starting at the top and moving in a clockwise direction, the first
word is written in a graceful script. The runes of the second word look
very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

    "Senthalliel kISu's'DorRz ENPRUHM puun-pe-uel"

All four of the runic words emit an eerie, pulsating glow. The ominous
glow illuminates a faint inscription etched into the sapphire.

As you recite the ancient rune words, the tiny jewels on the polished
bone staff begin to glow. First, the emeralds flash to life, followed

slightly, and she suddenly lurches forward and breaks free of the
invisible forces binding her!
