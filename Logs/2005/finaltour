47H 12V 3318255X 2007C Mem:10 Exits:NS> nAn Abrupt End
A small sign post is here, looking like it grew up from the ground.
A large green slab of marble rises from the ground here.

47H 10V 3318255X 2007C Mem:10 Exits:S> touch slabAs you lay your hands upon the cool green surface of the marble the ground
beneath your feet begins to shake. A large hand made entirely of dirt
breaks through the earth and grabs a hold of you before you have time to
react. The hand begins to squeeze the life out of your body. Just when you
begin to lose a grasp on life a booming voice fills the area.

'Grunch, Halt!'
'Spare that one, put my new pupil some place dry.'

With that, the voice disappears and the hand rears back, apparently to let
you down. Just as you begin to feel safe, Grunch catapults you with a
mighty heave. As your flight begins, you start to fall asleep and dream of
better days.

beneath your feet begins to shake. A large hand made entirely of dirt
breaks through the earth and grabs a hold of you before you have time to
react. The hand begins to squeeze the life out of your body. Just when you
begin to lose a grasp on life a booming voice fills the area.

'Grunch, Halt!'
'Spare that one, put my new pupil some place dry.'

With that, the voice disappears and the hand rears back, apparently to let
you down. Just as you begin to feel safe, Grunch catapults you with a
mighty heave. As your flight begins, you start to fall asleep and dream of
better days.

Just when you are about to give up, something rubs against your finger and
you decide to make a hasty exit from the clay. Before you have time to
react, something grabs your arm and pulls your whole body into the moist,
disgusting clay.

You are tugged along only for a few seconds, when the ride is over you are
full of clay and can hardly see anything. After wiping the clay from your
eyes you get a bearing on your surroundings. You are underground, for there
is no sun, but that is all you know.
