A Path Between the Sea and Cliffs
    There is little room to walk and maneuver on this small beach path
between the vast ocean to the north and the tall cliffs to the south.
Despite its size, the path is well-traveled by local fisherman who bring
their daily catch to markets in Vogler and Kalaman. Conspicuous shards of
broken coral lay scattered on the beach and path. The rocky path continues
to the east while a boat waits for fisherman to ferry them to Kalaman.

    The rocky path from the west ends here as tall cliffs block further
progress to the east. Numerous crustaceans crawl around in shallow pools
of water here, foraging for food while they wait for the tide to arrive.
A gap in the cliffs to the north leads to a calm harbor where fishing
boats can safely drop anchor. Beyond that, a sandbar rises out of the
expansive ocean. The Vingaard Estuary can barely be made out to the west
while to the south, cliffs form the edge of the path.

mostly still with the occasional wind driven wave passing through. A soft
breeze blows through here and there, but nothing like the fierce winds of
the sea ahead. Several boats, belonging to local fishermen are moored here,
rocking in the wind. A small sandbar rises out of the water to north while
waves gently lap against the tall cliffs to the south.

provides much needed protection for the men who fish these waters, rain

edge of the sandbar while larger waves from the open sea break upon the
northern edge. Away from the salty sea, a lone palm tree stands toward
the center of the small island.

can be seen scattering the pack.  Although chilly, the seas are rather

On the Ocean Floor
    Strong currents move along the surface of the ocean floor. No light
reaches this far down, and it is impossible to see far through the pitch
black water. The pressure down here is almost crushing, and it would be
surprising to find an abundant array of sea life peacefully crawling on
the shifting sands. It is impossible to see what sorts of creatures might
hide beyond the impenetrably dark waters that continue in all directions.

    Twenty feet under, any light that filters through the surface is too
dim to illuminate anything in the water. Despite the darkness down here, it
is possible to make out fuzzy shapes moving slowly in the distance, but
there is no way to tell how big or dangerous the creatures out there might
be. There is no guarantee of safety in these waters, but one can swim in
any direction from here.

clear water as blue as the sky when the sun is out. When the seas are calm,
the water glitters like an fluttering blanket of fireflies. But when a
storm comes, the crashing waters are powerful enough to capsize even the
most stable ships. A gentle zephyr sweeps across the ocean's rhythmically
undulating surface.

A Path Between the Sea and Cliffs
    There is little room to walk and maneuver on this small beach path
between the vast ocean to the north and the tall cliffs to the south.
Despite its size, the path is well-traveled by local fisherman who bring
their daily catch to markets in Vogler and Kalaman. Conspicuous shards of
broken coral lay scattered on the beach and path. The rocky path continues
to the east while a boat waits for fisherman to ferry them to Kalaman.

A Path Along the Cliffs
    The rocky path from the west ends here as tall cliffs block further
progress to the east. Numerous crustaceans crawl around in shallow pools
of water here, foraging for food while they wait for the tide to arrive.
A gap in the cliffs to the north leads to a calm harbor where fishing
boats can safely drop anchor. Beyond that, a sandbar rises out of the
expansive ocean. The Vingaard Estuary can barely be made out to the west
while to the south, cliffs form the edge of the path.

A Calm Harbor
    Everything is calm here. The clear blue water beneath your feet is
mostly still with the occasional wind driven wave passing through. A soft
breeze blows through here and there, but nothing like the fierce winds of
the sea ahead. Several boats, belonging to local fishermen are moored here,
rocking in the wind. A small sandbar rises out of the water to north while
waves gently lap against the tall cliffs to the south.

    Shimmering hues of blue, green, and a peculiar gold, stream down from

the boats above from drifting away, dot the sandy bottom beneath the calm
harbor. Several sunken boats sit eerily on the harbor floor never again to
sail the seas. Farther to the north, sand and seashells have been gathered
by incoming waves, creating a mound rising slightly above the surface.

Around the Sandbar
    The mound of sand rises above the surface of the water to the east. A
small palm tree growing on the sandbar flickers in and out of view as the
changing water plays with the light. There are scarcely any fish here. The
few that remain are thin, bony and have difficulty swimming. An expanse of
sandy underwater desert lies to the north. It gradually descends into the
murkier water below. Silhouettes of anchor lines can be seen to the south.

of the cavern are incredibly smooth, with no jagged edges or protruding

odd how this came to be. The floor of the cave is sandy, silty and is home
to several species of sea grasses. An opening at the top of the cavern
allows light to filter through when the sun is up, while the western part

Beside a Colony of Brain Coral
    The colony of brain coral is a reef system in itself. It stands several
dozen feet above the sea floor and forms a perfect circle several feet in
diameter. Outside the reef, spiny lobsters circle the ring in an organized
fashion. All of the fish, on the other hand, have congregated inside the
ring, seemingly engaged by a ring of bubbles emerging from the coral heads.
Further from the bustling activity of the reef there is calm and order over
this small section.

isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water

the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.

assortment of very ornate decorations, though they are displayed in a most
grisly fashion. The severed arms of many different races are affixed to the
eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.

there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,

obscures one's vision. The crude stones give way to porous white coral to
up above and in the tunnel to the north. There, the gloom seems to clear as
clean water gently flows in through the tiny holes in the coral. West from
here, the faint outline of some gigantic sea creature is barely visible
through a strange bubble-like barrier. A faintly lit chamber lies off to
the east, its walls glowing dimly through the murky green water. Muffled
chatter can be heard from some unknown source, echoing off the walls.

chamber where the sahuagin gather to conspire. Stagnant green water fills

walls are made of ancient stones that have been piled high, whereas the
northern wall consists of a solid mass of white coral. The chamber is lit
by small glowing orbs that are suspended in the water, tethered to the
stone floor by long vine-like plants growing out of cracks between the
crumbling stones. The dim lights sway with the currents, casting dancing
shadows that skip across the grimy stone walls.

A Large Meeting Chamber
    Set apart from the rest of the temple is this small, secretive meeting
chamber where the sahuagin gather to conspire. Stagnant green water fills
the room with a thick and murky cloud of filth. The southern and eastern
walls are made of ancient stones that have been piled high, whereas the
northern wall consists of a solid mass of white coral. The chamber is lit
by small glowing orbs that are suspended in the water, tethered to the
stone floor by long vine-like plants growing out of cracks between the
crumbling stones. The dim lights sway with the currents, casting dancing
shadows that skip across the grimy stone walls.

up above and in the tunnel to the north. There, the gloom seems to clear as
clean water gently flows in through the tiny holes in the coral. West from
here, the faint outline of some gigantic sea creature is barely visible
through a strange bubble-like barrier. A faintly lit chamber lies off to
the east, its walls glowing dimly through the murky green water. Muffled

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Settlement
    At the intersection of the wide coral tunnels lays the center of the
sahuagin settlement. This chamber is quite large, tantamount to the great
square of Kalaman, only underwater. A large statue of an striking shark
stands at the center of the chamber, its vicious jaws open wide and ready
to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement
extends in all directions except for north, where the coral tunnels ends

The Sahuagin Settlement
    This part of the natural coral tunnel is smooth and uncluttered. The
home of the leader of this sahuagin settlement must live nearby and dislike
disturbances. The canopy of elkhorn coral above is densely packed, but still
leaves enough room for small slivers of light to filter through though even
during the day. Since there is never enough light from above, the sahuagin
have affixed a crude glass lantern to the coral growing on the southern wall.
The intersection of tunnels lies back to the west while the water becomes
chillier to the east. A large coral cave branches off to the north.

Outskirts of a Crude Settlement
    Still mostly covered by a canopy of elkhorn coral, the fringes of the
sahuagin settlement are bare and mostly desolate. There is no living coral
here, only heavily bleached skeletal remains of a once vibrant reef core.
Whatever killed the coral polyps must have been strong and versatile. None
of the hundreds of coral species here survived. The coral tunnel narrows
to the east while a soft glow can be seen to the west.

A Tunnel Through Solid Coral
    There is no canopy of elkhorn coral fingers here. Instead, the tunnel
has been bored through a solid mass of coral. Deep scratches left by the
jagged tools of the sahuagin mar the surface of the surrounding coral. In
fact, their workmanship is so poor that large chunks have been knocked
out of the walls as well. To the west, the coral tunnel opens up on the
outskirts of an underwater settlement. Below, the ragged tunnel narrows
considerably, forcing the sahuagin to pass through one after another.
The corpse of a sahuagin sentry is lying here. [2]

A Narrow Tunnel Through Solid Coral
    The ragged tunnel descends deeper into the solid coral, narrowing as
it turns towards the east. The massive coral formations surrounding this
tunnel lean in, creating a passage that would frighten anyone afflicted
with claustrophobia. It would be impossible for more than one individual
to swim through at a time, though the exit to the east has collapsed. A
cold current filters in through cracks in the rubble blocking the exit,
though there doesn't appear to be a way to get through.

Within a Dark Tunnel
    Rocks and stone lie scattered about. Fragments of broken coral are
strewn across the floor as a result of a tunnel collapse, providing jagged
features to the tunnel path. The tunnel seems bored directly into the
mountain, its original maker unclear. Peering deep into the tunnel provides
no clues as to where it leads or what the other side holds in store. Only
endless darkness seems to lie within.

Within a Dark Tunnel
    Journeying deep within the tunnel, only eerie silence greets the
intrepid. While darkness lies in both directions, small coral colonies line
the tunnel walls providing some welcome color at these otherwise cold and
soulless depths within the mountain. Small fish or invertebrates able to
withstand the pressure may have once inhabited the coral, but they seem to
have moved on to more temperate depths. Shifts in the patterns of stones
that line the ground suggest that the tunnel has seen recent use.

    A turn changes the direction of the straight and narrow tunnel, but
provides no hint as to the progress deep within the mountain. It's unclear
whether the end is near or still a great distance away. The once colorful
coral in abundance earlier in the tunnel has thinned out. Only the hardiest
of coral species can survive this deep without sunlight and nourishment.
Loneliness and cold silence keep the remaining coral company.

    The tunnel turns upward forming a shaft. Hardened coral embedded along
the tunnel walls form natural footholds and handholds and spirals upwards.
Natural indentations along the walls also look supportive and can be used
for grip. Footing upwards looks precarious but can be managed safely with
caution. Prior travelers must have been relatively surefooted to have

    Off in the distance, natural light provides a little illumination to
these ocean depths. Features of the waving fauna become more noticeable and
arise from the darkness. Small schools of fish swim and dart around the
coral, seemingly in a frolicking dance. Pebbles along the floor roll
slightly with the currents as the path slopes upwards toward the surface.
The depths are still cold however, but the light gives hope that the ocean
surface is near.

vertical stone cliff to the south and west rises out from the rocky shelf
floor and continues up beyond the ocean's turbulent surface above. A small

Upon a Turbulent Ocean
    The surface of the turbulent ocean roils forcefully in response to the
unpredictable weather out here. The tempestuous waters are dark and murky,
making it impossible to know what sorts of frightening monsters lurk down
in the gloomy depths. A sheer stone cliff rises off in the distance to the
west, while an ominous thunderstorm looms over the dark skies far north of
here. To the east and south, the seas seem to continue on forever.

Beneath the Turbulent Ocean
    Just beneath the ocean surface, any light that filters through is too
weak to illuminate anything in the chilly water. Dark shapes move silently
through the murky ocean depths, but it is impossible to tell what kinds of
dangerous sea creatures might be lurking out there. The cold ocean waters
seem to stretch on forever in all directions except to the west where the
waters seem to get much shallower.

surrounding darkness makes the chilly water that much more oppressive. Out
in the darkness, opaque shapes move silently through the murky water, but
it is impossible to discern if any fearsome sea creatures might be hunting
for prey. The frigid waters seem to stretch on forever in every direction
except to the west where a vertical stone cliff looms nearby.

by some sort of creature with massive claws. The work is quite crude, but
appears to have been done fairly efficiently. Soft beds of sea grass cover
the roughly hewn floor, and they look quite comfortable. A large weapons
rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin hangs from the southern wall, but
it seems to be empty. A collection of ornaments and trophies dangles from
the long bronze chains affixed to the low-hanging stone ceiling.
The spirit of an ancient sahuagin warleader floats here.
The spirit of a Knight of the Lily is hovering here.
The spirit of the mahkwahb ambassador is hovering here.
The spirit of a sahuagin sentry is hovering here.
You sense a life form.
An elite sahuagin guard floats here, eyeing the dark shadows.
A tough looking sahuagin prince floats here, contemplating his fate.

    This chamber has been laboriously carved out of the surrounding stone
by some sort of creature with massive claws. The work is quite crude, but
appears to have been done fairly efficiently. Soft beds of sea grass cover
the roughly hewn floor, and they look quite comfortable. A large weapons
rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin hangs from the southern wall, but
it seems to be empty. A collection of ornaments and trophies dangles from
the long bronze chains affixed to the low-hanging stone ceiling.

with disgusting piles of garbage and chunks of half-eaten flesh. Around the
perimeter, large niches have been scooped out of the walls, and the scuff

In the Belly of a Humpback Whale
    The fleshy pink stomach walls here in the enormous belly of a humpback
whale are dripping with caustic digestive juices. The muscular walls press
in tightly, slowly churning around the mush of billions of half-digested
plankton corpses. Up above, a flapping orifice connects the stomach to the
whale's esophagus, while its putrid intestines lie beyond another orifice
down below. A few fish bones are lodged in the thick folds of flesh.

ISLE OF SHADOWS
===============

BACKGROUND:

The history of the isle has almost all been lost in the chaos following the
Cataclysm. Once the cherished keep of a Knight of Solamnia, the dark island
has now been consumed by the forces of evil. All that is known about the
strange island now is from whispered tales and strange rumors of gathering
shadow and evil magic. Many of the stories are said to have been heard by
kender and so are quickly dismissed, but others are told by veterans of the
seas who claim to have first-hand knowledge of the strange place. It is
said that the island is of black stone with black sand beaches and black
trees all blanketed in an unnatural mist that obscures it completely almost
until you are upon it. None who have set foot upon the island have
returned.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

If the kender are to be believed it would take a very experienced group of
adventurers [30+] quite a bit of luck and skill to survive finding the
island, let alone progressing further than the Black Shoreline.

LOCATION:

Wrapped in a swirling blanket of mist and shadow the island is not easy to
find but sailors who sail from the Port of Balifor know well to avoid the
area near the Mistlestraits where the mists begin to thicken and the
shadows begin to dance.

TAELDETH
========

BACKGROUND:

Taeldeth began as a small settlement nestled deep within the forests south
of Newport. Blessed with some of the richest topsoil in the region, in time
Taeldeth has grown into a thriving farming town supplying neighboring
communities with fresh produce, however over the past few months trade has
slowed to a trickle.

Frightened merchants have returned from the once friendly community vowing
never to return. They bring back with them tales of terrifying howls heard
in the dead of night. They tell of men, women and children disappearing,
never to be seen again and bodies found horribly mauled and ravaged.
Understandably, fear and paranoia have run rampant.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Communications have broken down with the Taeldeth authorities, but from
last reports the local town militia has seized control, issuing a strict
curfew on all visitors. A determined group [20+] might be able to gain
entry, but the once friendly townspeople may no longer welcome strangers to
their town. While no one is sure what evil is preying on the good people of
Taeldeth, there might be no one left if it is not stopped soon.

LOCATION:

Taeldeth lies within the forests far southwest of Newport.

BANDITS' HIDEOUT
================

BACKGROUND:

The towns of Solace, Haven and Newport have been trading with each other
for many years, their merchants using either the roads or the White Rage
River to transfer their goods between them on a regular basis. Although
their caravans are sometimes attacked by thieves and bandits, these
unlawful gangs have been proved quite useless against the mercenary guards
hired to protect the merchants. Recently, however, things have changed. The
bandits' numbers have been greatly increased, their targets are selected
with great care and their attacks seem to be planned and organized. More
and more valuable merchandise is lost to their attacks, and the merchants
and citizens of Newport are becoming restless, demanding that their
government protect their property and ensure safe passage to the nearby
cities.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Although the bandits' attacks seem to be based on careful planning and the
element of surprise, the mercenaries protecting the caravans have a hard
time against them whenever combat erupts. A small group of low-mid level
adventurers [9-12] might be required to put an end to this threat.

LOCATION:

The mayor of Newport has dispatched groups of soldiers to track down and
eliminate the bandits' hideout, but it is well hidden in the vast forest to
the southwest of the city, and their efforts have been fruitless so far.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    A myriad of colors overwhelm the senses. Every color of the spectrum is
present upon this large, beautiful coral reef. The water is exceptionally
clear, allowing the suns rays to shine through during the day and give life
to the reef. Heads of brain coral, wings of fan coral and the long, wavy
fingers of elkhorn coral grow in dense and overlapping formations. There is
no organization to the giant reef. It seems to expand with no order making
it quite difficult to navigate your way through.
You sense a life form.

The Center of the Sahuagin Settlement
    At the intersection of the wide coral tunnels lays the center of the
sahuagin settlement. This chamber is quite large, tantamount to the great
square of Kalaman, only underwater. A large statue of an striking shark
stands at the center of the chamber, its vicious jaws open wide and ready
to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement
extends in all directions except for north, where the coral tunnels ends
abruptly at an underwater cliff.

A Strange Coral Tunnel
    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.

The forests to the west are made up of thousands of tall oaks, their
branches spreading outwards in a glorious canopy. This forest is the
boundary of the Qualinesti elves, their capitol Qualinost somewhere in the
northern parts. The road south leads eventually to the Kharolis Mountains
and on south to Tarsis.

A Fork in the Old Road
    A small path leads west of here, looking west you can see the path
winding through some hills. South of here the road leads into a quiet and
tranquil looking forest. To the north is more forest lands and an isolated
farm or two. The road north leads to the White-rage river. This part of the
road is known to the locals as the 'Old Road'. Old Road is wide in places
and is paved in some places with cobblestone.

A Dark Road in the Forest
    The forest grows thicker around the roadside, the branches over head
blocking out the sun. You hear the sounds of animals all around you. Since
its fairly dark here, you hear the sounds of night animals out looking for a
good meal. Looking east, the forest is not as thick and the path is lighter.
To the west the forest continues to encroach on the path making the daytime
vanish even more from your sight. You hesitate to go that way.

Emerging From the Forest
    The path on which you stand emerges from the surrounding forest
suprisingly quickly into a barren landscape marred by a recent attack by
the axes of loggers. The surrounding hills that rise up around you are
scarred with rotting stumps, and here and there sage brush occasionally
mars the landscape. Whether your eyes deceive you or not, the way westward
appears to lead downhill into a small valley.

A Well-travelled Road
    The road meanders in an east-west fashion through a series of low,
barren hills, slowly inclining to the east towards the distant forest. Some
small plant life borders the road in the form of sage brush and sparse
grasses, but very infrequently. Looking westward, you notice that the road
begins to curve to the south towards the distant mountains which contain
the fabled Keep of Pax Tharkas.

    Trees loom over you all around. The shade provided by their fresh

two directions. One being to the west heading up a small mountain, which
seems to have some sort of structure protruding from it. The other is east,

Path Around the Mountain
    The path continues to take you upward towards the top of the mountain.
You can no longer see the structure above you, due to a ledge blocking your
view. To your south is a large gorge that is spanned by a bridge that is
long overdue for some work. As you put one foot on the bridge it creaks and
almost crumbles altogether. Cringing, you can sense that this will not
support your weight and will send you plunging to your death.

    This old road travels east and west through an area of the forest that
looks to have been heavily logged recently. Numerous tree stumps line the
sides of the road, their previous owners having been carted off. While you

the road itself looks to be heavily trafficked, mostly coming from the east.

Dusty Road
    The road here starts to smooth out, as you approach. Dirt has been
pushed aside to provide barriers for the wagons which enter the fortress,
keeping them from flying off the side of the cliffs. Ahead you see torches
lining outer walls of the keep, providing a beacon at night for the many
merchants and caravans traveling here. The path continues its course
winding up the mountain to the west, and back down a small incline.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
A potion is lying here. [2]

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
A potion is lying here. [2]

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A grime covered board is here.

Deep Into The Forest
     The forest continues to expand in all directions. The trees grow tall
and strong here, giving shelter to the many forest creatures that inhabit
these woods. Eastward thorny bushes and thick ferns block travel more
effectively than a stone wall would, while to the north the trees and
bushes seem to form an almost impassable barrier.

Deep Into The Forest
     The forest is dense and grows in all directions. The trees are very
tall and old, perhaps rivalling the trees of the ancient elven forests of
nearby Qualinost. To the north, travel is made impossible by the thick
foliage and thorny bushes. Numerous small birds have built their nests on
the tree branches, and their singing fills the air.

The soft, pleasant sounds of the wild forest give way to the harsher sounds
of civilization. You stand before what seems to be a small camp made of
old, brown tents set up in an ordered fashion. The tents are covered with
tree branches; it looks like someone took care to hide this place from
curious eyes. A narrow passage among thorny bushes leads southward, toward
a dense forest.

A Small Wooded Trail
     People used to use this trail quite a lot, back before the days of
darkness, but this place is all but deserted.  Every so often, you see a
broken down wagon sitting on the side of this small path. Probably been
attacked and then looted for all it's worth. You shake your head in disgust
as you continue on.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
Someone has peeled a strip of green flesh off some unwilling goblin.

Solace Square
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
