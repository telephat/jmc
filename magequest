A Brightly Lit Room
    Light finds its way in to this naturally illuminated room by a large
chute in the cavern up above. The sun sneaks in and bounces off the walls
which are littered with countless gems, creating a strange luminance. There
doesn't seem to be a way out as the cavern walls block every exit. Bright
red light glints off the northern wall as the sun hits it. The ground is
littered with hundreds of gems, scattered amongst an assortment of rotting
bones. It seems whoever was here before never managed to escape.

l chute
The chute is high above you, and doesn't appear to be reachable by any
means. It is a good light source however.

Looking north:
A huge ruby is is set firmly in the northern wall.
Looking east:
The cavern wall is bare here.
Looking south:
A pile of rotting flesh lies here, looking soft and inviting.
Looking west:
A skeleton sits here huddled against the cavern wall.
Looking up:
From high above you, the sun manages to sneak in through an open chute.
Looking down:
Bones of different sizes add to the flavor of the ground.

    Light finds its way in to this naturally illuminated room by a large
chute in the cavern up above. The sun sneaks in and bounces off the walls
which are littered with countless gems, creating a strange luminance. There
doesn't seem to be a way out as the cavern walls block every exit. Bright
red light glints off the northern wall as the sun hits it. The ground is
littered with hundreds of gems, scattered amongst an assortment of rotting
bones. It seems whoever was here before never managed to escape.

Long (for a dwarf) grey robes hang off this theiwar's shoulders, marking
him a renegade. His hair matches his robes, showing him to be quite old.
Dusty grains of sand speckle his hair, and whenever he pulls components out
of the pockets of his robe, a little stream of sand falls from his hands.
Free of the sand golem now, he prefers to use magic in battle.
A dusty renegade mage has a few scratches.

Large brown boulders carved with wild runes lie on the ground. The wall of
the spire to the south is covered in runes and carvings that are too wild
to be designed by a mage of the conclave. An obvious entryway, though, is
nowhere in sight. From the north an awful smell emanates, while a path
extends to both the east and west.

A Clearing Adjacent to a Brown Spire
    A large clearing of forest opens in the area next to the brown spire.
Large brown boulders carved with wild runes lie on the ground. The wall of
the spire to the south is covered in runes and carvings that are too wild
to be designed by a mage of the conclave. An obvious entryway, though, is
nowhere in sight. From the north an awful smell emanates, while a path
extends to both the east and west.

A Clearing Adjacent to a Brown Spire
    A large clearing of forest opens in the area next to the brown spire.
Large brown boulders carved with wild runes lie on the ground. The wall of
the spire to the south is covered in runes and carvings that are too wild
to be designed by a mage of the conclave. An obvious entryway, though, is
nowhere in sight. From the north an awful smell emanates, while a path
extends to both the east and west.

The brown boulders are covered in claw marks and wild runes. They are

movable by any novice magic.

A Clearing Adjacent to a Brown Spire
    A large clearing of forest opens in the area next to the brown spire.
Large brown boulders carved with wild runes lie on the ground. The wall of
the spire to the south is covered in runes and carvings that are too wild
to be designed by a mage of the conclave. An obvious entryway, though, is
nowhere in sight. From the north an awful smell emanates, while a path
extends to both the east and west.
Grummish, the Bulky Brown Dragon is standing here.

    A huge heap of defecant, a pile of bones, and a collection of objects
used to sharpen claws and teeth lies on the floor here. The trees have
ceased growing here. This seems to be where a ferocious brown dragon
defecates and stores its most prized possessions: wood for sharpening its
claws, and the bones of its most recent meals. To the south lies a clearing
with some markedly fresher air.

small for the massive chain.
A small kender is in an excellent condition.

A Clearing Adjacent to a Brown Spire
    A large clearing of forest opens in the area next to the brown spire.
Large brown boulders carved with wild runes lie on the ground. The wall of
the spire to the south is covered in runes and carvings that are too wild
to be designed by a mage of the conclave. An obvious entryway, though, is
nowhere in sight. From the north an awful smell emanates, while a path
extends to both the east and west.

Right when you take your look away from the base, you happen to see a
glimmer. A blue outline in a trapezoidal shape.

and a large bed takes up over half the room. Squeezed into the remainder of

You try to listen to the hollyphant, but he cannot speak.

Suddenly, a voice enters your mind. It sounds like several, no hundreds of
voices all speaking at once. All saying the same message in perfect
unison. You hear an elderly woman, a gnome child, Lord Calof of Kalaman,
and Lord Soth of Dargaard Keep. You hear everyone, and no one.

'Welcome! I'm glad you've arrived here. The Conclave must have sent you.
You've passed my first challenge, which was learning how to fly. If you
want to proceed, all you have to do is say yes. If not, I hope you have a
way to get home!'

The hollyphant grins sheepishly and winks at you. He raises his trunk and
lets forth a trumpet so loud, you have to cover your ears and hide your
head.

The wind spins you around, getting you dizzy and forcing you to close your
eyes.

When things die down, and you feel it is safe to look, you glance around.
The hollyphant is gone. All that remains is a soft wind that envelops you
and follows wherever you go.

acrobatic ease, able to clear suprising distances with single bounds and

himself and the tree, springing into action whenever a ripened melon falls
from its branches. He dives, swings, leaps and invariably saves every
melon from smashing against the jungle floor, then ravenously devours his
favorite treat. Unfortunately, none of the melons ever fall from boughs
nearby enough to capture his movements and study them.

Within a Dense Thicket
     Innumerable plant species of all shapes, sizes, and shades grow
together here in thick bunches. Tall, lime-green grasses, dark green
ferns, purple-flowered thistles, long, creeping vines and many other
plants all compete for the same nourishing rays of sunlight during the
day. They tangle and weave together, braiding a thick, nettled wall of
vegetation several feet high to the east. The underbrush thins beneath a
copse of trees to the northwest, where most of the plants have been
trampled and matted down to the earth in a vaguely circular pattern. The
bushes and shrubs nearby have been stripped of their flowers, berries and
many of their leaves. The heavy grazing, matted vegetation as well as many
small piles of dung give the distinct impression that this is some
animal's nest.

short trees to the northwest. Dozens of pacing hoofprints have trampled
and matted the grass and other less delicious greenery, the majority of
which are small and seem to belong to very young animals. All the signs
indicate that this is a nesting site, guarded by at least one adult. A
deep depression in the grass suggests that sort of heavy object once
sat here, but it appears to have vanished. In fact, there's nothing
terribly interesting around here right now.

l baby
This little warthog can't be more than a few weeks old, but is already
capable of ravaging the plant life around himself. His tusks have yet to
develop and his fur looks thin and fuzzy: without parents to protect him
he would never survive for long. He scampers back and forth through the
nest, devouring every tasty morsel he can find and trampling everything
else. This hog would clearly never snub any food he comes across, even
giving brief chase to taste-test dung pellets when they roll from being
kicked by tiny careless hooves.

Barely any larger than a squirrel, this tiny monkey has no problem hanging
and swinging from the slender, fern-like branches of the majority of the
jungle's trees. He is covered head to toe in a sticky crimson substance,
as if he had dived into and bathed within a very juicy melon. His hands
and feet are crimped strangely, perfect for climbing but awkward for
walking along the ground and he seems unwilling to leave the trees even
when something should peak his attention upon the jungle floor. The fronds
he rests upon are far too weak for the one skill he could teach to be of
use, but perhaps he could be helpful in another way.

finds himself too close to them. She snarls, grunts and paws the earth in
mock charge whenever she spots even the slightest threat to her young,
determined to protect them at any cost. Only a fool would approach any
closer unless she retreated further into the nest and was distracted by
other potential threats.

     The hard stone shoulders of the statue are gradually being worn away
under the dual attacks of time and weather. Large cracks run through its
arms and hands, barely able to support the long metal spear in its
clutches. The statue has suffered decapitation from some source, a jagged
stone stump taking the place of its neck and head. Even with a head this
statue would have been shorter than any of the fern-like trees surrounding
it, and is well hidden by the greenery from a distance. A wide chasm to

sturdy and would provide good leverage in a pinch. In addition, it is at

loudly as she goes about her monkey business. She plays on and around the
behemoth statue, able to maintain her grip quite easily as she scales its
height and swings around its girth. Her movements are too quick and random
to easily follow and learn from, but perhaps she could be tricked into
demonstrating her superb climbing abilities more clearly if a tasty morsel
was thrown up at the statue for her to chase after.
