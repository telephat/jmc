Sphere   : None
Usage    : cast 'atonement' [char in room]
Duration : Instantaneous
Effects  : Atones victims who have lost required guild status

returned to grace with this spell. In order to do so, the caster must be of 
higher level than the victim| the victim must also be sufficiently penitent
(ie, those Paladins/Rangers must show some remorse and be of good alignment
in order for atonement to be granted or dark knights who have regained their
dark and evil mentality).
