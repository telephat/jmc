Ahmed stretches out his crook of gnarled oak and whispers some words...

The crook begins to shudder as new buds sprout all along the twisted old
wood. From the buds grow slender branches and from the branches unfurl a
host of bright green oak leaves till the crook looks more like a freshly
uprooted bush. A moment passes and the branches begin to wither, the leaves
turning bright orange then fire red then finally dark brown. With a passing
wind the dead leaves and branches fall to the ground and the crook is a
crook once more.

A spirit of autumn winds now follows Ahmed.

365H 136V 1X 9125C Exits:W> l alchemist    Wrapped in a magically aura which the other members of the Aurinite
Order lack, this Aurinite was obviously born for the pursuits of the mind
and not for combat. His light yellow crystal body looks almost like a long
robe, though you can clearly make out a pair of legs below it. Before you
can react, he creates an illusionary bird which flies to you then
disappears. You can almost see a smile spread across his crystal lips
before he returns to work. Carved into the back of his robe body is the
symbol of the Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's wings.

Temple, this Gargoyle looks to have an intelligence the others lack. His
body is smaller than his brethren, and his muscles less developed, though
you suspect that he more than makes up for it in intelligence. Even with a
smaller appearance, you can see an almost literal fire burning behind his
eyes, which makes his appearance even more nightmarish. Burned onto the
back of each of his hands is the symbol of the Gargoyle Clans, a snake
wrapped around a shining sword.
