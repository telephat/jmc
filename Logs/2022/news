<i>The kings, emperors, and other royal rulers of Krynn toll the bells of</i>
<i>lamentation today for one of their own. Hearing this earnest supplication,</i>
<i>the Arctic Gods will hold a bonus event this weekend in celebratory</i>
<i>remembrance of the seventy year reign of Queen Elizabeth II.</i>

<i>Friday, September 9th 12:00PM UTC to Monday, September 12th 10:00AM UTC,</i>
<i>experience, coins, and rank experience gains will be doubled.</i>

<i>Go forth and adventure in observance of the only English sovereignty most</i>

<i>At the height of summer, when the sun is at its hottest, the barriers</i>
<i>between elemental planes grow thin.</i>

<i>At these times it is common for druids to perform rituals to worship the</i>
<i>greater Elementals. However, there are reports of one such ritual going</i>
<i>horribly wrong in the Sandy Cove south of Balifor. If a rift between planes</i>
<i>has been opened there is no telling what might come through, and the</i>
<i>dangers it might represent to this world if left unchecked...</i>

<i>The seasonal Midsummer instance zone has a 24-hour lockout, meaning each</i>
<i>character can only enter once per 24 hours. There is also a 90 minute</i>
<i>'timeout' timer to complete an instance. Should players perish in the</i>
<i>instance, corpses will automatically be cast out of the rift after the</i>
<i>instance expires (approximately 5 minutes after being empty, or when the</i>
<i>'timeout' timer expires, whichever happens first.) The seasonal event will</i>
<i>be available for a few weeks while many of us remain indoors to avoid the</i>
<i>summer heat waves.</i>

<i>Thanks to Jorquin for creating this seasonal zone for us, with Alecto's</i>
<i>help on many room descriptions.</i>

<i>- Anista</i>

<i>June 19, 2022</i>

<i>We have decided to extend the current bonus event for one extra day.</i>

<i>Double experience, rank exp, and coins will continue through Monday June</i>
<i>20th 11:59PM UTC.</i>

<i>Congratulations are in order for the winners of Saturday's PvP tournament:</i>

<i>Winning the 2v2 tournament were Vra and Mosher! Hinde, Rahvin, and Belka</i>
<i>stepped away with the big win for 3v3s!</i>

<i>Following the exceptional tournament of blood and gore, a 'triple double'</i>
<i>weekend is on the horizon. Double experience, rank exp, and coins will be</i>
<i>enabled from Friday June 17th 12:00PM UTC to Sunday June 19th 11:59PM UTC.</i>

<i>Immortal applications are now open for those willing to set their mortals</i>
<i>and friends aside to contribute to the game. Do you have what it takes to</i>
<i>make an impact on ArcticMUD? (HELP IMM APP)</i>

<i>Last but not least, the next pwipe will be several months away, but</i>
<i>preparation is beginning soon. Please be sure to submit all your ideas,</i>
<i>bugs, and typos via the respective commands in-game| those will be</i>
<i>addressed on our development port over the next few months. With the new</i>
<i>wipe, we are expecting to introduce at least four new and/or expanded zones</i>
<i>of various difficulties. Expect to see some new creator names surface with</i>
<i>some of the new content.</i>

<i>                 *** Tournament Announcement ***</i>

<i>Saturday June 11th, beginning at 5PM UTC (1PM EST, 10AM PST), we will be</i>
<i>hosting Player versus Player (PvP) tournaments for 2v2 & 3v3 matches.</i>

<i>Details:</i>

<i> - Items and containers will NOT frag in the arena.</i>
<i> - Self-prep & group-prep spells are allowed in peaceful rooms upon entry</i>
<i>   to the arena.</i>
<i> - No outside prep permitted. (i.e.: pre-buff, wands, scrolls, potions)</i>
<i> - Use of "orbs" is restricted in tournament play.</i>
<i> - Corpses and spirits will exist in the arena for those who need them.</i>
<i> - Fights can be spectated by players. Check the signage in an inn of any</i>
<i>   major city on tournament day.</i>

<i>2v2 Specifics:</i>
<i> - You may pick your own group member or we will attempt to pair you up</i>
<i>   with someone else as numbers allow.</i>

<i> - No character swaps are allowed after the tournament has started.</i>

<i>3v3 Specifics:</i>

<i>check in with the immortal staff within 30 minutes of tournament kick-off</i>
<i>on Saturday June 11th.</i>

<i>Even if you do not enjoy participating in PvP, we still encourage you to</i>
<i>enter the contest to check out the hard work we've done on the automated</i>
<i>arena design and fight 'spectate' system. Everyone who competes in the</i>
<i>tournament will receive something in return. And, of course, the fiercest</i>
<i>gladiators will undoubtedly walk away with the largest prizes. No refunds.</i>

<i>May you all die,</i>

<i>- Anista & Bedal</i>

<i>Happy Holidays! </i>

<i>Gnomish toy factories are renown for mass producing toys at Christmas time</i>
<i>to bring happiness and joy to the children of Krynn, the most famous of</i>
<i>which is the legendary toy factory of Sandy Klorze.</i>

<i>Recently, rumors have been circulating of nefarious groups planning to</i>
<i>attack these facilities which, when coupled with reports of a frantic</i>
<i>gnomish tinkerer near the western gate of Palanthas seeking the aid of</i>
<i>stalwart adventurers, can only mean trouble. Or perhaps it represents</i>
<i>opportunity, as there will certainly be fantastic festive rewards for the</i>
<i>valiant heroes who save Christmas!</i>

<i>The seasonal Christmas instance zone has a 24-hour lockout, meaning each</i>
<i>character can only enter once per 24 hours. There is also a 90 minute timer</i>
<i>to complete an instance. The event will be available between now and New</i>
<i>Year's Day.</i>

<i>Special thanks to Jorquin for creating this masterpiece, and most</i>
<i>importantly, Merry Chistmas and Happy New Year to you all!</i>

<i>- Clan 'promote|demote' is no longer case sensitive for character names.</i>
<i>- Learning 'nap' will show the spell name instead of an "unknown spell."</i>
<i>- The Kalaman shaman master now teaches transmogrify.</i>
<i>- Dynamic object names should now use the object noun as the primary</i>
<i>   name. Please typo report anything we may have missed.</i>

<i>           -------- PWIPE ANNOUNCEMENT UPDATE --------</i>

<i>                    You've all been deleted.</i>

<i>     The game will reopen for play December 3rd, 2021 at 11PM UTC.</i>

<i>We've successfully merged the development code into the live game branch</i>
<i>and are testing the implementation. All systems seem to be good so far.</i>
<i>Here are the patch changes for next wipe!</i>

<i>GENERAL</i>
<i>--------------</i>
<i>* The game year has been reset to be more in line with our 'War of the</i>
<i>   Lance' creation period. (The rolling year counter was originally set</i>
<i>   August 11, 1990 and this is the first reset ever.)</i>
<i>* Additional signs have been added around the Solace area to assist new</i>
<i>   players.</i>
<i>* Players will see min and max stats of their guild/race selection after</i>
<i>   selecting a race in the menu. This will display for both new and</i>
<i>   reincarnating characters. (Our menu options have changed, please make</i>
<i>   your character selections carefully.)</i>
<i>* Several 'death traps' alongside major roads and lowbie areas have been</i>
<i>   removed or made recoverable.</i>
<i>* Mobs won't try to use the gaze skill while it is still on cooldown.</i>
<i>* Fixed a bug preventing mobs from quaffing some helpful potions.</i>
<i>* Mobs won't quaff healing potions if they're at high health.</i>

<div class="t 766"><i>* Fixed a major bug where "increased healing bonuses" applied by the</i></div>
<i>   legendary cleric, druid, and shaman ranks were not being calculated</i>
<i>   correctly. This results in reduced overall curing at legendary compared</i>
<i>   to the last several wipes. However, the ranks now work as originally</i>
<i>   stated and intended. We'll be monitoring to see if anything needs to be</i>
<i>   rebalanced as a result of this.</i>

<i>   and AWARENESS.</i>

<i>* Primal fury' base spell stats improved. The spell has been changed to</i>

<i>   higher circle.</i>
<i>* Primal fury legend rank removed. </i>

<i>Mages (Magic Users & Robes):</i>
<i>-----------------------------------------</i>

<i>* All shaman guildmasters should now teach the spell transmogrify.</i>

<i>                --- THIS IS A PWIPE ANNOUNCEMENT ---</i>

<i>We hope you earned your fill of candy and treasures from the Halloween</i>
<i>event! The Haunted Mansion vanished and the Candy Collector returned home</i>
<i>until next year.</i>

<i>As Arctic enters 30 years of development, we'll be closing another chapter</i>
<i>in the game's rich history books. The posting for new immortal applications</i>
<i>is also closed at this time.</i>

<i>Sunday November 28th, at approximately 1:00PM UTC (system time), you will</i>
<i>all be deleted. Arctic will remain closed to mortals until Friday, December</i>
<i>3rd at 11:00PM UTC.</i>

<i>Here are a few teasers for things to come in the new wipe:</i>
<i>- Several zones have either been expanded or received a full redesign.</i>
<i>   Expect some new, elite level challenges!</i>
<i>- Additional holiday instances will be introduced.</i>
<i>- A few additional item sets will be added.</i>
<i>- The 'dynamic items' system will be reworked to roll a bit more favorably</i>
<i>   and many load locations will have changed.</i>
<i>- A variety of other changes are coming, including the return of a</i>
<i>   racial age bonus system.</i>

<i>We'll let you know the full development details following your timely</i>
<i>demise. Please try to keep the chaos and random pkiling under control until</i>
<i>the final hours of the wipe.</i>

<i>Lastly, the immortal staff are busy with developments during this time:</i>
<i>annoying the staff, pestering them for buffs, or asking them for inside</i>
<i>information about the wipe may result in an early personal pwipe at their</i>
<i>discretion! No reimbursements.</i>

<i>                 *** Tournament Announcement ***</i>

<i>Saturday, April 17th at 6PM UTC (2PM EST, 11AM PST) we will be hosting the</i>
<i>first Player versus Player tournament in several wipes!</i>

<i>This tournament will test our brand new 'arena' code, which -may- allow us</i>
<i>to automate arenas in the future. As this is entirely new code, we request</i>
<i>as much player participation as possible.</i>

<i>      We will be hosting & scoring 3 brackets: 1v1, 2v2, & 3v3.</i>

<i>Details:</i>
<i> - Any level 25+ player can compete in any bracket. We will attempt to</i>
<i>   match teams as fairly as possible in the first round.</i>
<i> - Bring your own gear. </i>
<i> - Equipment will NOT be lost on death in the arena.</i>
<i> - Items and containers will NOT frag in the arena.</i>
<i> - Groups must be of equal numbers. You will pick your own group members,</i>
<i>   or we will try to help you find some friends if time permits.</i>
<i> - Self-prep & group-prep spells are allowed in peaceful rooms upon entry</i>
<i>   to the arena.</i>
<i> - No outside prep permitted. (i.e.: pre-buff, wands, scrolls, potions)</i>
<i> - Use of "orbs" is restricted in tournament play, but will be allowed in</i>
<i>   free-for-all skirmishes following the main events.</i>
<i> - Corpses and spirits will exist in the arena for those who need them.</i>
<i> - Fights can be spectated by players. Check the signage in an inn of any</i>
<i>   major city on tournament day.</i>

<i>If you plan to participate and know your team in advance, we ask you to let</i>
<i>us know your planned bracket(s) and group members ahead of time.</i>
<i>(Preferably by Friday.) Please email gods@arcticmud.org or message a</i>
<i>non-retired immortal in-game to reserve your spot. Pre-registered players &</i>
<i>teams must check in with the immortal staff within 30 minutes of tournament</i>
<i>kick-off on Saturday.</i>

<i>Even if you do not enjoy participating in PvP, we still encourage you to</i>
<i>enter the contest to check out the hard work we've done on the automated</i>
<i>arena design and fight 'spectate' system. Everyone who competes in the</i>
<i>tournament will receive something in return. And, of course, the fiercest</i>
<i>gladiators will undoubtedly walk away with the largest prizes.</i>

<i>Lastly, following the structured tournament play, we will allow free-for-all</i>
<i>skirmishes to test multiple arena fights in parallel. Arena fights will be</i>
<i>entirely randomized and use of prep will be unrestricted. No refunds.</i>

<i>May you all die!</i>

<i>Leprechauns have been spotted around Krynn. Collect your rainbow fragments</i>
<i>and hold onto them until the event ends! It's every man for himself! Can</i>
<i>you taste the rainbow at the end? One elusive leprechaun is worth his</i>

<i>Players will also receive 100% bonus coins and experience for the duration.</i>

<i>Arctic Rules Enforcement Policy Notice</i>
<i>======================================</i>
<i>When we began allowing legal play of one additional character per person,</i>
<i>an extended set of rules were written around 'multiplay' and 'botting.'</i>
<i>(See HELP RULES.)</i>

<i>Due to players being found in excessive violation of the current 'no </i>
<i>botting' rules, this is a notice that the immortal staff will be strongly</i>
<i>enforcing all rules listed for all players.</i>

<i>Immortals have full authority to run tests for anything they deem</i>
<i>necessary, silently or intrusively. The staff is not out to ruin anyone's</i>
<i>fun, but we have an interest of creating a fair and reasonable play</i>
<i>environment for everyone.</i>

<i>Any trigger that involves combat, skilling, or has the capability to</i>
<i>perform actions to progress the character while away from the keyboard is</i>
<i>almost certainly against the current game rules. If you have questions</i>
<i>about a specific trigger, please see HELP RULES first for a number of</i>
<i>allowed (and disallowed) examples. If you still find things unclear, or</i>
<i>have a violation to report, please contact a level 33+ immortal or email</i>
<div class="t 1141"><i>gods@arcticmud.org.</i></div>

<i>In short, if you are playing two characters, the staff expects you to</i>
<i>"play" both. If you cannot "play" two characters within the game rules</i>
<i>(E.g.: no automated combat abilities, such as rescue/curing/casting/assist</i>
<i>/etc on either character), then we expect you to "play" no more than one</i>
<i>character at a time.</i>

<i>Thank you for observing and playing by the game rules.</i>

<i>Arctic Gods</i>

<i>February 20, 2021</i>

<i>- SPELL_PENETRATION will no longer drop the victim's resistances below zero.</i>

<i>UTC, mortals will receive a 50% increase to experience, ranks, and coins.</i>

<i>Can you feel the love? Be aware, cupid's arrow may sting through the ages,</i>
<i>but the Ansalon love fest ends on Saturday, before our respective paramours</i>

<i>  than the barbarian.</i>
<i>- Blocked moment of clarity will show up in score.</i>

<i>  increase or decrease permanently during your play, but would reset to its </i>
<i>  proper values after rent, while moves, saves, and BASH_MOD might increase</i>

<i>- Each guild 'relearn' has been combined into one item, removing failure for</i>
<i>  all circles for the guild.</i>
<i>- "Chaos" spell loads have been added for every guild. These allow a player</i>
<i>  to learn a random spell from the specific book/tablet/charm. They can load</i>
<i>  anything from a lower tier spell to the most elite, so they are very rare.</i>
<i>  The load locations are chaotic and may move around regularly.</i>
<i>- Black robes will require 'relocate' for legendary, rather than 'pain.'</i>
<i>  (Pain is now a guild spell.)</i>
<i>- White robes will require 'fireshield' for legend instead of 'cleanse.'</i>

<i>for a few hours between 11am and 5pm UTC every weekday. Debug mode will</i>
<i>crash earlier and with no foom message. After each crash, we will be</i>
<i>reverting to normal mode as soon as possible while we analyse the crash</i>

<i>           -------- PWIPE ANNOUNCEMENT UPDATE --------</i>

<i>                     You've all been deleted.</i>

<i>     The game will reopen for play January 1st, 2021 at 8PM UTC.</i>

<i>We've successfully merged the development code into the live game branch</i>
<i>and are testing the implementation. All systems seem to be good so far.</i>
<i>Without further ado, here are the full patch notes for next wipe!!!</i>


<i>GENERAL</i>
<i>-------</i>
<i> * Player vs player damage is set to 75%.</i>
<i> * Vault alchemy limits have doubled.</i>
<i> * The shout cooldown timer has been reduced by half.</i>
<i> * After an item has been 'lored,' its stats can always be viewed with</i>
<i>   the 'inspect' or 'examine' commands, until the item is destroyed.</i>
<i> * Lored items no longer show 'timer' messages unless they are NORENT.</i>
<i> * Lored items will now show BASH_MOD values, if any exist.</i>
<i> * The 'systat' command will display bonus events, if any are active.</i>
<i>     (E.g.: Exp bonus  : 50%)</i>
<i> * Players affected by SUSTENANCE will still be able to eat and drink.</i>
<i> * Fear affects will prevent an affected player or mobile from hunting</i>
<i>     or tracking.</i>
<i> * Disorientation will now show appropriate wear off messaging.</i>
<i> * MINDSHIELD will properly protect against disorientation effects from</i>
<i>     critical hits.</i>


<i>EXPERIENCE/RANKS</i>
<i>----------------</i>
<i> * The base exp table has been reduced by 20 million, all at level 30.</i>
<i> * The rank experience table has been reformulated, primarily at rank 31</i>
<i>     and beyond to allow for an increased rank cap.</i>
<i> * The rank level cap (pre-reincarnation) has been increased to a much</i>
<i>     larger number, although it will be difficult to achieve max rank.</i>
<i> * The 'rank' command now displays the player's current rank.</i>
<i> * New rank merchants have appeared in Kalaman, Palanthas, and Tarsis.</i>


<i>REINCARNATION</i>
<i>-------------</i>
<i>* NEW COMMAND: reincarnation. Displays bonuses earned by reincarnating.</i>
<i>* Maximum reincarnates is now 5, down from 6.</i>
<i>* Reincarnations give +1 to a bonus stat per reincarnation, instead of +2.</i>
<i>* Reincarnation adds -1 saving_spell (r1/r3/r5) and -1 saving_poison</i>
<i>    (r2/r4), instead of -1 saving_spell every time.</i>
<i>* Reincarnation race selection will now respect character alignment.</i>
<i>* Less experience is required for each reincarnation, as a result of the</i>
<i>    base experience table reduction.</i>
<i>* Rank purchases and legendary status will not be removed by reincarnating.</i>
<i>* Skill progress will not be lost upon reincarnating. Skills and spells</i>
<i>    will be capped at maximum for the current level.</i>
<i>* Reincarantion will grant 50 CRP. (Clan rank points.)</i>
<i>* Reincarnating will now properly remove spell affects.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 1547"><i>* Scout 'fence' and dark knight 'stance' will be cleared on reincarnation.</i></div>
<i>* Character height and weight will now update to reflect any changes in</i>
<i>    race after reincarnating.</i>


<i>RACES</i>
<i>-----</i>
<i>* Dargonesti (exotic) base strength may roll slightly lower, charisma</i>
<i>    slightly higher.</i>
<i>* Gnome spell damage bonus increased slightly.</i>
<i>* Goblin base strength may roll slightly higher.</i>
<i>* Gully dwarf (exotic) can now follow both good and neutral alignments.</i>
<i>* Half ogre (exotic) can now be scouts.</i>
<i>* Hill dwarf base charisma may roll slightly higher. Concentration bonus</i>
<i>    slightly reduced.</i>
<i>* Silvanesti learn bonus reduced slightly, base intelligence may roll</i>
<i>    slightly lower, movement regen increased.</i>
<i>* Exotic races are now only accessible by reincarnating into them: the</i>
<i>    menu creation option has been removed.</i>


<i>CLANS/CLAN STRONGHOLDS</i>
<i>----------------------</i>
<i>* The 'clan who' command will show the number of reincarnations and</i>
<i>    legend status of clan members.</i>
<i>* New stronghold command: 'clan stronghold map'</i>
<i>    Displays a 2D grid of the stronghold floor plan, including asset</i>
<i>    names and locations.</i>
<i>* Rooms can -only- be linked to match a proper 3D grid, which helps</i>
<i>    avoid previous linking problems outside the stronghold.</i>
<i>* New clan room linking syntax: clan stronghold link <dir>. (No longer</i>
<i>    accepts room ID.)</i>
<i>* New assets: General Store, City Portal (one per stronghold max), Clan</i>
<i>    Ward. See HELP STRONGHOLD ASSETS for details.</i>
<i>* Clan stronghold room names will now display the room asset type.</i>
<i>* Reduced room requirement to asset ratio to 1:1.</i>
<i>* The coin cost of stronghold rooms will no longer increase with</i>
<i>    stronghold size.</i>
<i>* Reduced the withdrawal charges for clan stronghold bank assets.</i>
<i>* Depositing coins at the clan stronghold bank stores half of the fee</i>
<i>    in the clan's vault, if one exists, to help pay for future stronghold</i>
<i>    updates.</i>
<i>* The number of reincarnations and legendary status of clan members can</i>
<i>    now be seen with the 'clan who' command.</i>
<i>* Strongholds now prevent demolition of rooms with assets.</i>
<i>* Fixed a bug preventing strongholds from having both banks and vaults.</i>
<i>* Fixed a bug with 'clan abandon' leaving stronghold rooms behind.</i>


<i>AFFINITY/MEDALS</i>
<i>---------------</i>
<i>* Hobgoblins are now a proper mob race, and have been added to affinity</i>
<i>    medal objectives.</i>
<i>* Retrieving affinity medals from vaults will no longer cause a debuff.</i>
<i>* Triggering medal enchantments no longer affects the objective timers.</i>


<i>NEW OPTS/PROMPTS</i>
<i>----------------</i>
<i>* New prompt option: prompt TIC_TIMER. Displays seconds until tic.</i>
<i>* New player option 'opt IGNORE_IMMUNE_TRACK.' Allows a player to toggle</i>
<i>    on and off their 'TRACKABILITY' if their character is affected by</i>
<i>    IMMUNE_TRACK or IMMUNE_HUNT.</i>
<i>* New player option: opt TARGET_WATCH_OPP. This will allow a player to</i>
<i>    cast an aggressive spell on their 'watch_opp' by default without</i>
<i>    typing the target.</i>

<i>    Example:</i>
<i>      Kholos is 'watching' Anista who is fighting Lord Soth.</i>
<i>      Kholos casts 'acid blast' with no target specified. The 'acid blast'</i>
<i>        will hit Lord Soth.</i>


<i>HELP FILES</i>
<i>----------</i>
<i>After much debate, we've decided to pull back the curtain 'just a little</i>
<i>more' on player help files. Where needed, each spell and skill has received</i>
<i>a new "Details:" section describing the ability. Not -every- spell or skill</i>
<i>received this, but many did.</i>

<i>The new help file details will not disclose exact mechanics, or any</i>
<i>detailed values, but players should now have a more clear idea on what</i>
<i>their abilities affect or do.</i>

<i>To go along with this change, we've also added HELP FLAGS to aid in</i>
<i>understanding of spells, skills, and ranks purchased by players.</i>

<i>Please use the in-game 'typo' command to report any issues found, as this</i>
<i>project was a major undertaking and there are likely issues.</i>


<i>NEW ITEM SYSTEM</i>
<i>---------------</i>
<i>Nearly five thousand NEW items have been created and added to the game as</i>
<i>part of a supplementary gear & weapons system:</i>

<i>* These items can load on various monsters across the game. Some items are</i>
<i>    class specific, and some can be used by all.</i>
<i>* The item stats are randomized and draw from a wide range of possibilities.</i>
<i>* The strength of stats, and the number of stats applied to these items, is</i>
<i>    primarily determined by the difficulty of the monster and a certain</i>
<i>    amount of luck!</i>
<i>* While these items are rare, they are unlimited and every zone in the game</i>
<i>    can load some of these items.</i>
<i>* This is a fairly complex system. Expect us to be turning knobs & dials</i>
<i>    behind the scenes throughout the wipe.</i>


<i>ZONES/CREATION</i>
<i>--------------</i>
<i>Jelek and Telvan have both returned to the game! Travelers beware, the</i>
<i>townsfolk are not fond of trespassers with pure intentions. Special thanks</i>
<i>to Anista for obtaining a backup zone copy & recoding the files from the</i>
<i>ancient programming language to the new, and to Jorquin & Alecto for giving</i>
<i>the zone a proper creation facelift. See HELP AREA JELEK, HELP AREA TELVAN.</i>

<i>The Laughing Lands has been added to the game, as yet another expansion</i>
<i>near Balifor created by Alecto. The Laughing Lands region is for high level</i>
<i>adventurers with a modest group size. See HELP AREA LAUGHING LANDS.</i>

<i>Many mobiles throughout the game have had their experience points adjusted,</i>
<i>both positively and negatively. Kagonesti Hinterlands & Neraka's inhabitants</i>
<i>received the biggest overall reductions per-zone, while Hjor's Arena &</i>
<i>Neraka's Green Dragonarmy Camp received much-needed increases.</i>

<i>* Some inns which had been deactivated have been reactivated, allowing</i>
<i>    players to rent in more places.</i>
<i>* Several rooms have become recuperate areas where appropriate.</i>
<i>* Theros has learned to repair any item which he creates.</i>
<i>* "Orbs" will no longer apply a permanent debuff penalty to hitpoints and</i>
<i>    movements for improper use| the affect will now be temporary.</i>
<i>* 'Shark jaw crossbows' have returned to the game, albeit not as powerful as</i>
<i>    they once were.</i>
<i>* The 'crown of grapes' is less powerful than it once was.</i>
<i>* Numerous other items, mobs, and rooms were touched in various ways ways.</i>


<i>SPELLS/SKILLS (GENERAL)</i>
<i>-----------------------</i>
<i>* Most spell loads (book/spell combinations & many load locations) have</i>
<i>    changed for every guild. Expect to see some old book names from the '90s</i>
<i>    resurface! Shaman charms will now all have 'charm' in their name to help</i>
<i>    with the 'reset' of this system.</i>
<i>* Damage over time spells (rotting flesh, corrode, ignite, etc) will no longer</i>
<i>    engage the caster if they are not tanking the victim when the damage pulses.</i>
<i>* "Cloud" code has been reworked to fix some longtime bugs. Notably, grouped</i>
<i>    members should no longer be hit by their groups' offensive cloud spells if</i>
<i>    they are not present with the friendly caster at cast time.</i>
<i>* The 'scribe recipes' and 'brew recipes' skill commands will now work while</i>
<i>    the skills are on cooldown.</i>

<i>   bonus affect from this spell.</i>

<i>* Lightning damage-over-time effects (i.e.: from shocking blast, etc) will</i>
<i>   not engage the caster if the victim is focusing on another target.</i>

<i>Shaman:</i>
<i>-------</i>
<i>* Shamans will now receive bonus memorization slots based on charisma.</i>
<i>* Ancestral blessing now adds a healing bonus for all shaman healing spells</i>
<i>    while active. This healing bonus was removed from a portion of the</i>
<i>    legendary regenerate rank. (There is no overall loss or gain in healing</i>
<i>    bonus with this change.)</i>
<i>* Bind will no longer remove previously bound spirits on items if the new</i>
<i>    bind attempt fails.</i>

<i>    if the caster fails a control, but still passes the CHA check.</i>

<i>    changed slightly, but those who know it before should have no problem.</i>

<i>Thief:</i>
<i>------</i>
<i>* Fading when not tanking will not lag.</i>
<i>* Legendary fade will no longer trigger refresh. Instead, the thief will</i>

<i>VARIOUS BUG FIXES</i>

<i>* Fixed hundreds of bugs and typos submitted by players via the 'bug' and</i>

<i>* Fixed a bug where players would receive cooldown messages for various</i>
<i>    guilds on tic.</i>
<i>* Fixed a number of issues causing game crashes.</i>
<i>* A lot of code for clan strongholds, spells, and skills was redone. Please</i>
<i>    use the 'bug' command to report anything weird happening.</i>


<i>OTHER</i>
<i>-----</i>
<i>We went through the entire ideas list (at least seven years worth) and</i>
<i>implemented some of the ones we liked. Quite a few ideas were reserved for a</i>
<i>later date. If your idea is still unimplemented, and you think it's really</i>
<i>good, then please resubmit this wipe with the 'idea' command.</i>


<i>STAFF UPDATES & SPECIAL THANKS</i>
<i>------------------------------</i>
<i>We've put up fliers all around the Darken Woods for our sneaky kender Kam,</i>
<i>who has gone missing and hasn't been seen for quite some time. We've retired</i>
<i>him from his post as a game implementer and reserved him a spot with our</i>
<i>retirees. The Goblin Battlemasters, Anista (head of gameport) and Kholos</i>
<i>(head of creation), will continue to run all aspects of the game. Always</i>
<i>remember, these goblins are your friends, but they also have very, very sharp</i>
<i>teeth: Beware.</i>

<i>Special thanks to our long-time veteran coder Adepali for his work throughout</i>
<i>the wipe. Adepali still spends many hours behind the scenes designing new</i>
<i>features,  and some of his best work is still yet to come...</i>

<i>It is with our greatest pleasure to recognize and give special thanks to our</i>
<i>biggest immortal contributors last wipe. While a number of other immortals</i>
<i>have contributed work, no amount of thanks can be given for the painstaking</i>
<i>volunteer time the following staff members contributed. Please congratulate</i>
<i>these immortals for their promotions and thank them for their hard work in</i>
<i>making the game enjoyable for all:</i>

<i>Alecto - promoted to 34.</i>
<i>Bedal - promoted to 33.</i>
<i>Bro - promoted to 33.</i>
<i>Cinas - promoted to 33.</i>
<i>Kafilat - promoted 34.</i>
<i>Lloth - promoted to 33.</i>
<i>Loopley - promoted to 34.</i>
<i>Mick - promoted to 32.</i>

<i>And finally, the biggest 'special thanks' goes out to the playerbase. Without</i>
<i>players like you, our work here would be meaningless.</i>

<div class="t 1844"><i>In closing out this wipe, we hope most of these changes are taken well, and</i></div>
<i>sorry (not sorry) to the cleric corpses who continuously embarrassed the damage</i>
<i>dealers in the group until now. Overall the changes are intended to be positive,</i>
<i>and we look forward to presenting you with a wipe full of amazingness and a</i>
<i>dedicated staff to keep the 25+ year old game going.</i>

<i>Who knows, we might decide to implement some of these other "didn't quite get</i>
<i>finished in time" pieces later this wipe...</i>

<i>Thanks for playing Arctic.</i>

<i>      ------------- THIS IS A PWIPE ANNOUNCEMENT -------------</i>

<i>                           May you all die.</i>

<i>          You will all be deleted on December 30th, 2020.</i>
<i>          The new wipe will begin on January 1st, 2021.</i>

<i>We hope you enjoyed 2020 as much as we did. In the spirit of closing the</i>
<i>book on everything the year brought us, we will be wiping the playerbase on</i>
<i>the day of December 30th, 2020 and will reopen in the new year. We will</i>
<i>announce specific times and more details as the date gets closer.</i>

<i>This wipe saw a number of great changes to the game, including the</i>
<i>squashing of a number of longstanding bugs that had been plaguing us for</i>
<i>years. We'd especially like to thank everyone who assisted with our debug</i>
<i>sessions, without which it would have been very difficult to diagnose some</i>
<i>of the problems. (Thank you for using the 'bug' command.)</i>

<i>As a cause for celebration, everyone will receive a 100% increase</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 2047"><i>experience, coins, and rank gains through the end of the current wipe,</i></div>
<i>beginning with this post.</i>

<i>Please try to keep the chaos and random killing under control until the</i>
<i>last few days of this wipe. We may hand out some buffs and goodies then.</i>

<i>Below are some of the highlights you can expect to see next wipe:</i>

<i>- The reincarnation and rank systems, as well as experience tables will</i>
<i>  have some adjustments.</i>
<i>- New zones are in the works, with some nostalgia included.</i>
<i>- A major gear/weapon system is being designed to help with a item limits,</i>
<i>  dull loads, and allow for re-playability of "maxed" zones. This system</i>
<i>  would not entirely replace the existing, but supplement it. We may not</i>
<i>  have enough time to fully implement this, but we're pressing hard for it.</i>
<i>- The blueprints for clan strongholds are being reviewed and expanded.</i>
<i>- Class skills and spells will have some noteworthy changes.</i>
<i>- Many helpfiles are receiving some facelifts. Trust us, it's worth being </i>
<i>  excited about!</i>
<i>- Numerous quality of life improvements are to come, for newbies and</i>
<i>  veterans alike.</i>
<i>- Quite a few additional bugs are being worked out of the system. </i>

<i>    There have been strange sightings of paranormal activity in and around</i>
<i>the Haunted Mansion of Kalaman Graveyard. If you should try to venture</i>
<i>inside, it may be wise to bring some company so they can retell the</i>
<i>stories of your heroic deaths!</i>

<i>    Back by popular demand, last year's Haunted House returns to game for</i>
<i>the spirit of Halloween. Originally this zone was used to test our new</i>
<i>'instance' code, by which a zone automatically replicates itself to be</i>
<i>run by multiple groups at once.</i>

<i>    The zone will only be available for a short while. We hope you enjoy</i>

<i>    I've (hopefully) fixed some various issues with the Knight of the Rose</i>
<i>   quest for Paladins, the following should now work correctly:</i>

<i>   - Your corpse, or possessions, should be returned to the starting room.</i>
<i>   This does happen at certain times, but should never take longer than</i>
<i>   seven minutes or so. Messaging may look a little odd, if anyone notices</i>
<i>   and it does, let me know.</i>

<i>   - Mobs should all be removed correctly before the quest is restarted.</i>
<i>   You should not begin the quest and immediately run into things that</i>
<i>   shouldn't be showing up for a little while.</i>

<i>   - You should not get unwillingly thrown back into the quest after losing</i>
<i>   and returning.</i>

<i>    If any of these issues, or other issues come up, please report them</i>
<i>   with the 'bug' command. Also if it seems like a complicated bug and you</i>
<i>   want to expedite the process, you can send me a message and log of the</i>
<i>   issue if possible on the ArcticMUD discord server, which can be found on</i>
<i>   the login screen.</i>

<i>   Scouts may notice some enlightened bretheren resting in their guilds in</i>
<i>  most of the major cities. These journeyed hunters can be looked to for</i>
<i>  guidance with your spiritual path through nature. For those new to the</i>
<i>  guild, they will set you on the path to your higher instincts, and offer</i>
<i>  clues and advice for your travels.</i>
<i>  </i>
<i>   Upon typing 'learn all' at a guild you will be given quests for</i>
<i>  currently available spirit animals, these quests can be viewed with the</i>
<i>  'quests' command, or the optional 'quests finished' after you have bonded</i>
<i>  with them. Beyond this, if you 'listen' to these scouts, they will give</i>
<i>  you a list of animals available for advice, simply say which one you</i>
<i>  would like to know about.</i>

<i> **Now The Important Part**</i>

<i>   As of yet, the only thing these will affect is what information this</i>
<i>  scout will aid you with, so if you have already hunted these animals</i>
<i>  there is nothing to lose by missing the quests. Also, due to some</i>
<i>  technicalities, people who have already hunted the animals will be given</i>
<i>  quests, there was no way around this currently. I have been manually</i>
<i>  setting characters as I see them on with the proper quests, if you want</i>
<i>  to hurry it along, or have any input on it feel free to tell to me if you</i>
<i>  see me on. Also if you notice anything wrong, aside from the above</i>
<i>  mentioned, please let me know or use the 'bug' command. This was a sort</i>
<i>  of preliminary test thing so it may have other issues, change, or go</i>
<i>  away.</i>

<i> - The clan stronghold BANK asset now includes personal vaults.</i>

<i>   see alternate races as affinity objectives in the future.</i>

<i>   DOUBLE EXP WEEKEND begins now!</i>
<i>   </i>
<i>   Experience gains will be doubled until late Sunday or early Monday AM,</i>
<i>   depending on your timezone.</i>
<i>   </i>
<i>   Please celebrate our promotions with us (and also Lloth's newborn baby</i>
<i>   girl!)</i>

<i>   - Your new Goblin Overlords</i>

<i>May 14, 2020</i>

<i>  Friends, goblins, hooligans!</i>

<div class="t 2094"><i>   We are proud to announce yet another promotion of our smelliest goblin</i></div>
<i>   battlemasters! Their continued efforts for the game remain unparalleled</i>
<i>   and as a result they must be punished with yet more responsibility!</i>

<i>     Anista has been doing incredible work for the game, coding away</i>
<i>     many long standing issues as well as bringing some great new</i>
<i>     features to the game. His tireless work on zone approval and</i>
<i>     creation have helped get lots of new content into the game and he</i>
<i>     has also been a great asset in his handling of mortal affairs. As</i>
<i>     such, we are naming him the new head of gameport so that he can</i>
<i>     continue to improve the game for us all.</i>

<i>     Kholos continues to be a masterful zone creator and mentor to</i>
<i>     other members of the creation staff, both new and old. His zones</i>
<i>     are some of your favorite and also your least favorite (because</i>
<i>     they kill you so often). His vision and talent for creation have</i>
<i>     been a driving force behind new content in the game and so is only</i>
<i>     fair that he become the new head of creation so that he can help</i>
<i>     shape the future of content for the game.</i>

<i>     Kam, meanwhile, will continue on in his role as someone who mostly</i>
<i>     does nothing but takes credit for all the good stuff that seems to</i>
<i>     happen near him. The most masterful jerk, the cleverest kender,</i>
<i>     the head implementor will continue to oversee all aspects of the</i>
<i>     game and guide the goblins in their new roles (with leashes, and</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 2297"><i>     maybe whips, but definitely disinfectant and air freshener).</i></div>

<i>   Please congratulate Anista and Kholos when you see them online, which</i>
<i>   should be often, while they do all the things to make the game you love</i>
<i>   even more lovable (and horrible).</i>

<i>  May you all die.</i>


<i>April 15, 2020</i>

<i>Bug fixes:</i>

<i>- Triggered medal effects will last for their full duration and won't expire </i>
<i>upon tic.</i>
<i>- Mobs dying on the tic (e.g. by poison effects) should now award normal</i>
<i>exp/ranks.</i>
<i>- Ancestral spirit will provide proper bonuses to all races.</i>

<i>Adepali</i>

<i>April 14, 2020</i>

<i>Hello friends,</i>

<i>  It is I, your new Maza Overlord. I have directed the insect known as</i>
<i>  Adepali to perform repairs on my new mud so that scouts who are fencing</i>
<i>  as they reincarnate will no longer be troubled when they start again</i>
<i>  with their new life.</i>

<i>You are welcome, infidels.</i>

<i>- Nostramazos.</i>

<i>March 27, 2020</i>

<i>This announcement is several hours delayed, but today marks a historic</i>
<i>event: the spell components system has become even more useful and easier</i>
<i>to track!</i>

<i>Whenever a character successfully brews or scribes a spell for the first</i>
<i>time, the spell formula will be 'mastered' and committed to memory.</i>

<i>Mastered recipes can be seen with "brew recipes" or "scribe recipes,"</i>
<i>depending on the skill type. A '*' in front of a spell's name indicates</i>
<i>that it can be crafted with current components on hand.</i>

<i>Furthermore, "brew recipes components" or "scribe recipes components" will</i>
<i>list ONLY spells for which the caster holds components to craft.</i>

<i>Please reference HELP SKILL BREW, HELP SKILL SCRIBE, and HELP COMPONENT</i>
<i>SYSTEM for further information.</i>

<i>May you all die,</i>

<i>-- Anista</i>

<i>March 21, 2020</i>

<i>A small patch was added in the recent reboot. Here are some of the details.</i>

<i>Bug fixes:</i>

<i>  - Fixed a long-time issue where certain special weapons did not train</i>
<i>    skills properly.</i>
<i>  - Clerics can now command two animated corpses pre-legend, and one</i>
<i>    additional at legend as intended.</i>
<i>  - Several zones which have always been 'force load' now reset properly|</i>
<i>    please feel free to report others with the 'bug' command.</i>
<i>  - Resolved several issues causing game crashes. We may offer 'foom'</i>
<i>    bounties in our future debug sessions, so please participate.</i>

<i>Additional QoL:</i>

<i>  - Affinity progress can now be tracked on the prompt:</i>
<i>        prompt attunement_progress</i>
<i>  - The duration of ethereal armor has been increased.</i>
<i>  - Shaman spirits aren't quite as terrible at dealing damage.</i>

<i>May you all die,</i>
<i>-- Anista</i>

<i>March 16, 2020</i>

<i>We will keep running debug sessions every weekday from 10am until our first </i>
<i>crash over the next few days.                        </i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>Adepali</i>

<i>March 15, 2020</i>

<i>  Tomorrow, Monday March 16th at 10AM UTC (6AM EST, 3AM PST), another debug</i>
<i>  session will take place. During this time the game will be less stable</i>
<i>  than usual. We plan to debug for approximately 4 hours.</i>

<i>  We encourage everyone to help us with our data collection. You can help</i>
<i>  us by skilling, fighting, questing, and generally playing the game as you</i>
<div class="t 2344"><i>  normally do. If you believe you can crash the game with something during</i></div>
<i>  this window, then feel free to try it (once.)</i>

<i>  Many "foom" issues have been discovered and fixed from the help of the</i>
<i>  recent debug sessions. We will continue to run debug sessions as needed.</i>

<i>  If no game crashes occur during the final portions of the debug window,</i>
<i>  then we will leave the game in the debug state until the first crash</i>
<i>  occurs. After this, it will reboot into a more stable mode.</i>

<i>  Thanks for your patience and understanding!</i>

<i>- Adepali & Anista</i>

<i>March 13, 2020</i>

<i>Today's debug session revealed another bug that would be otherwise impossible</i>
<i>to find. Thanks again for your help and patience.  </i>
<i>Next debug session to start Monday 10am UTC.</i>

<i>Cheers,</i>
<i>Adepali</i>

<i>March 12, 2020</i>

<i>Thank you for your patience during the debug session today.</i>
<i>Two bugs have been fixed, but more remain.</i>
<i>I will run another round on Friday March 13, 10:30am - 2pm UTC.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 8, 2020</i>

<i>Medals and march should now work as expected.</i>
<i>I will run another debug session next Thursday, 10am - 2pm UTC.</i>
<i>Thank you for your patience!</i>

<i>- Adepali</i>

<i>March 7, 2020</i>

<i>I have disabled attuned medals until I can properly troubleshoot them.</i>
<i>In the meantime, they will behave like normal objects and will NOT be</i>
<i>saved in the vault if you die.</i>
<i>If you care, vault them now.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 7, 2020</i>

<i>The game is currently unstable as we're facing a few issues with the server</i>
<i>and some bugs.</i>
<i>We may crash more often than frequently.</i>
<i>We have also disabled some bugged features until we have the chance to</i>
<i>troubleshoot and fixed them properly.</i>
<i>For updates, see: http://mud.arctic.org/forums/index.php/topic,2464.0.html</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 7, 2020</i>

<i>Over the new few days we will be running the game in debug mode to track</i>
<i>down the bugs that have been fooming us lately. This may increase the</i>
<i>rate of fooms, but will give us the data we need to fix the issues. You may </i>
<i>also notice some lag.</i>

<i>- Adepali</i>

<i>March 3, 2020</i>

<i>   We would like to thank you all for a busy and productive start to the</i>
<i>   new wipe. Here are some additional changes we've made since kicking</i>
<i>   things off:</i>

<i>  - There are now more prayerbooks loading throughout the game. Clerics</i>
<i>    should hate life less.</i>

<i>  - Cloud Kingdom has been relocated to a very cold region of Krynn.</i>
<i>    See HELP AREA CLOUD KINGDOM.</i>

<i>  - Argand Keep was also moved, but not much. See HELP AREA ARGAND KEEP.</i>

<i>  - More helpfiles were updated, more were added. HELP COMPONENT is a big</i>
<i>    one.</i>

<i>  - Tons of bugs and typos already reported this wipe have been fixed.</i>
<i>    Thank you for your feedback, and please keep it up!</i>

<i>- Kholos</i>


<i>February 29, 2020</i>

<i>                              Wipe 20 begins!</i>

<i>  There is no amount of thanks that can be given to Kholos and Anista that</i>
<i>  will be appropriate. The majority of the work for this wipe, especially</i>
<i>  over the last few days has been done almost completely by them.</i>
<i>  Please thank them when you have the chance, don't waste your thanks on</i>
<i>  me.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 2547"></div>
<i>  Anista has stepped up into a role as our most active coder, fixing</i>
<i>  everything that's wrong with the game and making huge improvements all</i>
<i>  along the way.</i>

<i>  Kholos has become one of the best creators in the history of the game.</i>
<i>  You love his zones and so do we.</i>

<i>  There's some other stuff we changed.</i>

<i>- Some cleric spells moved circles.</i>

<i>  Have a great wipe,</i>

<i>February 28, 2020</i>

<i>                            Welcome to Arctic.</i>

<i>                        You have all been deleted.</i>

<i>                           Welcome to Wipe 20.</i>


<i>   There have been a lot of changes made to the game, please read the news</i>
<i>   post from February 18th for more of the wipe change details, or check</i>
<i>   the Development News section of the forum where a comprehensive list</i>
<i>   will be posted for the changes made for this wipe.</i>

<i>  Here's the stuff we didn't mention before:</i>

<i>  GENERAL:</i>

<i> - Class sets return to the game this wipe. Each piece will have</i>
<i>   randomized stats.</i>
<i>   The bonuses for each set as a whole will be static.</i>
<i> - We removed a very much beloved rank purchase. You will hate us for</i>
<i>   this.</i>
<i> - Dozens of new rank purchases have been added to the rank merchant, many</i>
<i>   of them are class-specific.</i>
<i> - Player spells will no longer frag objects carried by mobiles.</i>
<i> - Mobiles can still frag your objects. Other players can, too.</i>
<i> - Many evil mobiles throughout the game have adopted a slightly more</i>
<i>   neutral attitude.</i>
<i> - Numerous spells have been reclassified into more sensible spheres.</i>
<i> - Many brew/scribe 'recipes' have been changed to reflect this.</i>
<i> - Brewed potions and scribed scrolls have had a facelift. You will love</i>
<i>   us for this.</i>
<i> - Kantar has been given a pay raise. He will now work more hours.</i>
<i> - We added more dragons. We added some things that aren't dragons but are</i>
<i>   also scary.</i>
<i> - Dragons are scary, and they are many. Be cautious, we recommend it.</i>
<i> - The thing we mentioned about dragons is for real, you should be afraid.</i>

<i>   DIVINITY for details.</i>
<i>   This skill is a 'proof of concept' kind of thing and will likely change</i>
<i>   extensively in the future, but it should be pretty cool as it is.</i>

<i>  WARRIORS:</i>

<i> - Legendary punch won't disorient anymore, but may knock some fools down.</i>
<i> - Legendary Warriors no longer receive innate IMMUNE_DISARM. It's</i>
<i>   EXTRA_ATTACK_CHANCE now.</i>

<i>   bonuses.</i>

<i> - The 'fade' skill can only be used by players in combat.</i>

<i>  SCOUTS:</i>

<i> - Legendary scouts will no longer experience lag when logging in.</i>
<i> - Legendary instincts will no longer be lost after reincarnation.</i>

<i> - The 'wolverine'/'anger' damage bonus has been reduced.</i>

<i> - The Legendary Worg rank is dead. Long live Legendary Yeti. See HELP</i>
<i>   LEGENDARY SCOUT.</i>

<i>   DRUIDS:</i>

<i>  Wipe 19 was very good to druids. It was nuts, but great to see them on</i>
<i>  top for once. That being said, everyone should have known this was</i>
<i>  coming:</i>

<i> - Druid spells frag objects again, but not those carried by mobiles.</i>
<i> - Some spells have changed circles.</i>
<i> - All tablets have been changed and load locations may differ.</i>
<i> - Hitpoints for druids have been reduced slightly, mostly at level 1.</i>

<i>   Conclave's blessing.</i>
<i> - All robes will gain slightly more hitpoints while levelling.</i>
<i> - Tethered characters will now respect movement & room restrictions.</i>
<i> - The range for 'astral beacon' has been increased significantly.</i>
<i> - Those skilled at 'spellcraft' will no longer have trouble with low/mid</i>
<i>   components.</i>
<i> - The 'deep focus' skill is no longer about studying, but more about</i>
<i>   magic. See HELP SKILL DEEP FOCUS.</i>

<i>  PALADINS:</i>

<i> - The 'freedom' spell will now remove the affects of holy word.</i>
<i> - The 'beseech' skill used without arguments will show a list of valid</i>
<i>   options.</i>
<i> - The 'slam' skill should work more often, and always on immobilized</i>
<i>   targets.</i>




<i>  This was a lot of work, it would not have been able to happen without</i>
<i>  the high level of dedication from our team who have done a tremendous</i>
<i>  job all wipe long. Please take the time to thank the following people</i>
<i>  when you have a chance:</i>

<i>  Most importantly Anista and Kholos who have been doing so much for the</i>
<i>  game this last wipe and especially in the rush up to starting this new</i>
<i>  wipe.</i>
<i>          This list of changes and additions would be much</i>
<i>          shorter without them.</i>

<i>  Thank you Aristox for continuing to help guide us and do the hard jobs</i>
<i>  nobody else can do.</i>
<i>  Thanks as always to Adepali for supporting us in code and who also has</i>
<i>  even more surprises in store for us yet this wipe, just you wait.</i>

<i>   Big thanks to the rest of the wipe crew who helped with many tasks:</i>
<i>                 Alecto, Cinas, Kafilat, Lloth, Loopley</i>

<i>   The game takes a lot of effort and these are the people who have done</i>
<i>   all the work, but we are nothing without you jerks as well, and we</i>
<i>   thank you for continuing to play this game and help us to guide and</i>
<i>   shape it throughout the years.</i>
<i>   To those of you returning from a few days away or a few months away,</i>
<i>   welcome back. To those of you returning after many years, welcome back</i>
<i>   and please reach out to the staff for help getting reacclimated to the</i>
<i>   game, so much has changed, but so much is still the same.</i>

<i>          Arctic will shutdown on Thursday, February 27.</i>
<i>     We will dance on your graves, then delete you completely.</i>


<i>   The game will open again on Saturday, February 29.</i>
<i>   We expect this will occur around 17:00UTC/system time.</i>
<i>   If it's a little earlier or later, blame a goblin.</i>


<i>   Enjoy the end, jerks.</i>

<i>February 18, 2020</i>

<i>   Hello, jerks!</i>


<i>   We have been hard at work getting things done for the new wipe and</i>
<i>   discussing which changes will ruin your lives most effectively. We've</i>
<i>   already gotten a lot of work done and we are ready to share some of</i>
<i>   that info with you now.</i>

<i>   Please note that these changes are not active in game presently.</i>
<i>   They will be live when the new wipe begins, not before.</i>

<i>GENERAL:</i>

<i>  - The corpses of players will now last twice as long before decaying.</i>
<i>    Inconvenient for those of you with a penchant for DTs (oeoe) but good</i>
<i>    for others.</i>
<i>  - You can now open and close containers while resting. We've come so</i>
<i>    far.</i>
<i>  - The 'pardon' command is now global. Some messaging was removed so it</i>
<i>    isn't annoying.</i>
<i>  - Items that decay in rent will now show the actual name of the item.</i>
<i>  - Exotic characters are now able to select ANSI option in the character</i>
<i>    creation menu.</i>
<i>  - Players can now open doors when 'nightfall' is active.</i>
<i>  - FEATHERFALL objects will now have the same effect as the spell.</i>
<i>  - The 'repose' spell will now work appropriately when resting</i>
<i>    underwater.</i>
<i>  - The 'blindness' spell will now last half as long, both in and out of</i>
<i>    combat.</i>
<i>  - Shopkeepers and receptionists now detect invisibility and have</i>
<i>    nightvision.</i>
<i>  - Spell components have been altered in many small ways.</i>
<i>    Mostly they should last longer, be cheaper, weigh less and rent for</i>
<i>    less.</i>
<i>  - Dumps, swamps and oceans should no longer destroy items.</i>
<i>  - The world merchant is no longer concerned with item alignments.</i>
<i>  - The bounty boards have been removed from the game after 15ish years of</i>
<i>    being unused.</i>

<i>CLANS & STRONGHOLDS:</i>

<i>  - Clan elders can now increase their clan's size without the chieftain.</i>
<i>  - Maximum clan size has also been doubled since you all have so many</i>
<i>    friends.</i>
<i>  - The stronghold 'GROVE' asset will now allow use of 'prevailing winds'.</i>

<i>ENCHANTMENT/AFFINITY MEDALS:</i>

<i>  - All players in a group eligible for an objective will receive affinity</i>
<i>    experience.</i>
<i>  - Items with maximum affinity will no longer receive new quests.</i>
<i>  - Disenchanting will properly remove all bonus attributes.</i>
<i>  - Enchantment effects can now be triggered with by using 'say'.</i>
<i>  - Many zones have been added to the affinity objectives.</i>
<i>  - Deadbeating your affinity items now reliably returns it to your vault.</i>

<i>ZONES, ZONES, ZONES:</i>

<i>  - We have modified the zone classification system. We have added an</i>
<i>    'elite' category.</i>
<i>  - The listing of zones in HELP AREA has been updated and several zones</i>
<i>    have been appropriately reclassified.</i>
<i>  - Quite a lot of zone helpfiles have been updated for consistency and</i>
<i>    those which did not list suggested level ranges now do.</i>
<i>  - New helpfiles have been added for the following areas:</i>
<i>    (Note that these are not new zones, just new helpfiles which did not</i>
<i>    exist before.)</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA BALIFOR DOCKYARDS</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA CELESTIAL VALLEY</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA FORGOTTEN CRYPT</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA THE MUSHROOM FOREST</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA PHAETHON VILLAGE</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA SILVANESTI SECRETS</i>
<i>                  HELP AREA TANTALLON</i>

<i>  - The Plains of Dust have been replaced with.. the Plains of Dust.</i>
<i>    This is an all new zone and more or less complete reimagination of the</i>
<i>    entire region. What we have now, thanks to Kholos and his merry band</i>
<i>    of helpers, is an expansive and more thoroughly concepted rendition of</i>
<i>    the area which offers a wide variety of mobs and quests for players of</i>
<i>    all levels and alignments. See HELP AREA PLAINS OF DUST for more</i>
<i>    details.</i>

<i>  - The road network connecting Tarsis and Port Balifor has been affected</i>
<i>    by this change but should still feel familiar and make much more sense</i>
<i>    geographically. Other zones attached to the road should still be easy</i>
<i>    to find.</i>

<i>  - The village of Lantern is gone but some of its residents found new</i>
<i>    homes elsewhere.</i>

<i>  - The MERCHANT CAMP zone has been moved slightly to accomodate road</i>
<i>    changes. The difficulty of this zone has also been reduced slightly.</i>

<i>  - Hillshar has been added to the game near Port Balifor.</i>
<i>    See HELP AREA HILLSHAR for details. Alecto-land continues to grow..</i>

<i>  - Mountain Fortress has returned to the game, now with less nonsense.</i>
<i>    See HELP AREA MOUNTAIN FORTRESS for details.</i>

<i>  - Graves' End has been renamed Shrivost. HELP AREA SHRIVOST for details.</i>
<i>    This zone received a thorough soft revamp and should be better than</i>
<i>    ever.</i>

<i>  - The 'Archimedes Quest' has been re-implemented. We gave our best</i>
<i>    guess. Some small changes have been made to a number of zones to</i>
<i>    facilitate this.</i>

<i>  - Quite a few zone bugs in various places throughout the game have been</i>
<i>    addressed.</i>

<i>ITEMS:</i>

<i>  - The nerf to two-handed weapons has been undone. In fact, they're</i>
<i>    better than ever.</i>
<i>  - Some hundreds of items have been tweaked in many ways, mostly for the</i>
<i>    better.</i>
<i>  - Some top tier items have been brought back to the realm of reality.</i>
<i>  - Items that decay in rent have had their timers increased overall.</i>
<i>    We hate this system and are working on a new one, but this will have</i>
<i>    to do for now.</i>
<i>  - Some cool items have been moved around, other cool items have had</i>
<i>    quests associated with them changed in ways which we'll never tell you</i>
<i>    but clues now exist for.</i>

<i>   These are only some of the changes coming to us in the new wipe. There</i>
<i>   is still quite a lot more that we are not ready to share just yet.</i>
<i>   There are quite a lot of people to thank for all of this work, and even</i>
<i>   more for the rest of it but for now they will live in obscurity until</i>
<i>   they finish their damn jobs.</i>

<i>Thanks for playing,</i>

<i>- Kam</i>

<i>                             May you all die.</i>

<i>              You will all be deleted on February 28th, 2020.</i>
<i>              The new wipe will begin on February 29th, 2020.</i>

<i>   Wipe 19 has been very long, perhaps the longest wipe in the history of</i>
<i>   the game and we would like to thank everyone very much for their</i>
<i>   patience. This wipe brought a lot of changes to the game, we think</i>
<i>   mostly good and only some bad. There are many more changes in store for</i>
<i>   us in the coming wipe, and there will be another post to detail all</i>
<i>   (most) of that as we get closer to the wipe date.</i>

<i>    Today's broadcast marks the introduction of a new, temporary zone just</i>
<i>    in time for the spirit of Halloween. The zone will only be available</i>
<i>    for a short while but has an interesting new feature. The zone will be</i>
<i>    'instanced', in which it will automatically replicate itself to be run</i>
<i>    by multiple groups at once. We can all thank Adepali for providing us</i>
<i>    with this new feature. We hope you enjoy the featured zone and make</i>
<i>    sure to give your thanks to Kam and Alecto for helping out.</i>

<i>    There have been strange sightings in Kalaman Graveyard of a haunted</i>
<i>    mansion seeing some activity. If you should try to venture inside, it</i>
<i>    might be wise to bring some company with you so they can retell the</i>
<i>    stories of your heroic deaths! Remember, this zone will only be</i>
<i>    available for a short time so get it in while you can.</i>

<i>    May you all die, and rise again!</i>

<i>    The "group experience penalty" for level 30 characters has been</i>
<i>    removed. This comes at a penalty, as the "solo bonus" for level 30</i>
<i>    characters has also been removed. Regardless, this has been an overly</i>
<i>    requested change by the playerbase, so we're throwing you a bone.</i>

<i>    May you all die.</i>

<i>October 11, 2019</i>


<i>   There has been an update to "help skills". This should help to clarify</i>
<i>   how to skill progress especially at the upper levels of the skill. The</i>
<i>   way that skills train was changed many years ago, but if you weren't</i>
<i>   around during the news post you likely missed it or forgot.</i>

<i>   From 4PM systime tomorrow until late Sunday we will be hosting a DOUBLE</i>
<i>   XP WEEKEND!</i>

<i>   All experience gained will be doubled (rank xp is excluded from this</i>
<i>   bonus).</i>

<i>   This should help everyone have an opportunity to get in on the</i>
<i>   reincarnation feature we introduced last week and maybe even get a few</i>
<i>   people on their way to a second reincarnation!</i>



<i>   May you all die, and then be reborn, and hopefully die some more,</i>

<i>September 3rd, 2019</i>


<i>   We will be releasing the new REINCARNATION feature to the public for</i>
<i>   beta testing starting this week on Friday, September 6th.</i>

<i>   We are excited about this new element of the game and will open up a</i>
<i>   new section of the forums to hear your feedback and ideas about it as</i>
<i>   we all test through it further together. We've hit a point where our</i>
<i>   team of alpha testers has gotten the bigger issues cleared up (we</i>
<i>   hope!) so now we leave it to you to help us find any other problems.</i>

<i>   The basics of reincarnation are this:</i>
<i>   - At level 30/1X/rank 15 you can reincarnate.</i>
<i>   - You'll essentially reroll as a level 1 (you can choose a new race).</i>
<i>   - You'll receive some great bonuses so pay attention in character</i>
<i>     creation.</i>
<i>   - You'll keep your rank points (and receive 2 bonus rank points) but</i>
<i>     lose rank purchases.</i>
<i>   - You'll keep your spells/instincts (but will need to regain the</i>
<i>     slots).</i>
<div class="t 3078"><i>   - Your skills reset to awful but will train faster the second time</i></div>
<i>     around.</i>
<i>   - It will take a little more XP to level up again after each</i>
<i>     reincarnation.</i>
<i>   - You can reincarnate up to six times!</i>

<i>   You can read HELP REINCARNATION for all the details.</i>

<i>   We hope you enjoy all of Adepali's hard work on this cool new feature!</i>

<i>   Robed mages are now able to train robe-specific skills at all town guild</i>
<i>   masters, provided the basic knowledge of the skills has already been</i>
<i>   learned from the appropriate robed wizards in the Tower of Wayreth.</i>

<i>   This is in preparation for the upcoming 'reincarnation' code changes,</i>
<i>   which will allow robed mages to learn all 'magic user' skills in towns</i>
<i>   at lower levels.</i>

<i>   PS: Dark Knight guildmasters around Krynn also teach "Lily" skills.</i>

<i>   May you all die.</i>

<i>   we've just been fiddling with them a little bit, adjusting levels and</i>

<i>     A little late on getting these in, but some new helpfiles have</i>
<i>     been added to the game:</i>

<i>      Earlier today the village of Que Kul disappeared from the face</i>

<i>   different in appearance. The village is now larger than before and</i>
<i>   much more complex and boasts a larger population as well. The</i>
<i>   simple way of life known to the barbarians of the Que Kul tribe is</i>
<i>   of course still very much in evidence, but something more sinister</i>
<i>   seems to lurk just beneath the surface of the day to day</i>
<i>   activities of its citizens.</i>

<i>     strength and now wander the world of Krynn to exact their revenge.</i>

<i>     Some special holiday mobiles can be found wandering the world and</i>
<i>     they are of varying degrees of difficulty but all intended for higher</i>
<i>     level players and groups. Some holiday ribbons may be found when</i>
<i>     these creatures are defeated and these are coveted by the shopkeepers</i>
<i>     within the game and well valued. Those with more patience can wait to</i>
<i>     find Kam and turn them over to him for coins and potentially other</i>
<i>     rewards if you manage to collect quite a lot of ribbons.</i>

<i>     Happy holidays, everyone!</i>

<i>    The rate of dynamic rank experience gained by mobs between kills has</i>

<i>  - The druid spell 'mass fly' is a guild spell this wipe..</i>
<i>    find the hidden guildmaster, she'll teach you!</i>
<i>  - Oh yeah, druids can use axes this wipe, I forgot to mention that!</i>
<i>  - The affinity objects 'a plain silver ring' has been temporarily </i>
<i>    removed from the game, pending a few important updates from </i>
<i>    Adepali in the next few weeks.</i>
<i>  - Class sets have been temporarily removed from the game, pending </i>
<i>    the revamp of them that Kam ruined. Back soon, he promises.</i>

<i>    Also, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the incredible</i>
<i>    group of immortals who made everything possible for this wipe!</i>
<i>    </i>
<i>    Kholos made all of my dragon-related dreams come true and well</i>
<i>    beyond that, as well. His work over the last several months has </i>
<i>    been amazing and I look forward to watching you all die because</i>
<i>    of it. Please congratulate him on being promoted to level 34.</i>

<i>    Anista has been an incredible asset to the creation team, rising</i>
<i>    quickly to become a leader and teacher to our newer (many) or less </i>
<i>    intelligent (i.e. Willoe) creators. His help has been instrumental</i>
<i>    in getting done all the things we wanted to accomplish for the wipe,</i>
<i>    so please also congratulate him on his promotion to 34 as well.</i>

<i>    Rorc, once again, was an incredible asset in executing the many </i>
<i>    tedious and least fun tasks that we had to do during the downtime.</i>
<i>    He happily took on a pretty ridiculous workload and didn't stop </i>
<i>    asking for more to do until about 5 minutes before we opened the </i>
<i>    game. We couldn't have done it on time without him.</i>

<i>    Aristox fixed the druids. We can't possibly thank him enough for </i>
<i>    continuing to come out of retirement to help us make the big moves </i>
<i>    here on Arctic that really help improve the game for all of us in </i>
<i>    both big and small ways. Plus he's the one that stuck you guys with </i>
<i>    a kender overlord, so you definitely need to thank him for that.</i>
<i>    </i>
<i>    Flook is always there for me when I think a project can't possibly </i>
<i>    get done in time. He just takes it off my hands and fixes puts it </i>
<i>    all together and asks what else we need to get done. He's the best</i>
<i>    counterpoint a kender could hope for, we even live on perfectly </i>
<i>    opposite sides of the world, so one of us is almost always around.</i>
<i>    </i>
<i>    Thanks also to the incredible new class of creators who have zones </i>
<i>    that are either in the game already or coming very soon:</i>
<i>    Alecto, Rinad, Kholos, Iadus, Anista, Willoe, Flair and also me.</i>
<i>    You can expect another news post this week with the details of just </i>
<i>    which zones those are and where you might find them!</i>

<i>    I would also like to thank everyone who has taken the time to talk </i>
<i>    to me about ideas they have for the game or issues they have found.</i>
<i>    It's impossible for anyone to know everything about this game and </i>
<i>    those of you who take the time to be a part of the process are the</i>
<i>    ones who really deserve credit for many of the changes this wipe.</i>

<i>    Arctic means a lot to me, and I know it also does to many of you, </i>
<i>    so I would also like to thank everyone who logged on to play with </i>
<i>    us again. Without you, we wouldn't have a reason to do all this </i>
<i>    stuff or anyone to complain about it. So thank you, everyone.</i>

<i>    Arctic will always be here, for as long as I have a say in it.</i>

<i> August 31, 2018 --- Welcome (back) to Arctic.</i>

<i>  Thanks for being patient with us during the downtime. We know that</i>
<i>  waiting is hard and we hope that all the work we have done will make it</i>
<i>  worth it.</i>

<i>   A very important rule change will be in place this wipe:</i>
<i>- You may now have a maximum of TWO (2) characters logged per player..</i>
<i> -- These characters MUST share the same e-mail address.</i>
<i> -- All of the characters from you should have the same e-mail.</i>
<i> -- Violations or attempts to circumvent these rules will be very bad.</i>

<i>  A reminder of some other rules:</i>
<i>  - Character sharing is not allowed. Please don't. Please.</i>
<i>  - Names should be appropriate, you should know what isn't.</i>
<i>  -- When we change your name, it is for a reason, take it or don't use</i>
<i>     questionable names in the first place.</i>

<i>   On to the changes, let's start with druids.</i>
<i>   From the great and terrible Aristox:</i>

<i>   Druids got a significant facelift. This is not a full revamp, although</i>
<i>   one of those is in the works. These changes are an effort at</i>
<i>   rebalancing the class enough to make it viable in the game again. The</i>
<i>   changes listed below are not everything, but these are the highlights.</i>

<i>   Please report any bugs you come across, but also try to confirm they</i>
<i>   are bugs and not -intentional- new features.</i>

<i>DRUID SPELLS:</i>
<i>- We removed some spells.</i>
<i>  -- create food, create water, faerie fog, gust of wind, infravision</i>
<i>- We made some spells divine.</i>
<i>  -- free action, sustenance</i>
<i>- barkskin, iceskin and daze have had their duration improved.</i>
<i>- feast, plant walk and prevailing winds can now be cast almost anywhere.</i>
<i>- sense life now also grants infravision.</i>
<i>- summon faerie now makes the caster permanently lit.</i>
<i>- faeries do what they want.</i>
<i>- water breath now affects everyone in the room at level 20+.</i>
<i>- blur is now more effective.</i>
<i>- enlarge doesn't have a downside, and the upside has improved.</i>
<i>- entangle (and all web affect spells) will no longer 'grab' your weapons.</i>
<i>- primal fury no longer restricts potions, scrolls and running away. Other</i>
<i>  negatives have mostly been removed and the good stuff is mostly more</i>
<i>  gooder.</i>
<i>- healing cloud now does two casts of cure serious (instead of one cure</i>
<i>  critical) and lasts longer.</i>
<i>- cure massive is a new spell.</i>
<i>- cultivate has been rebuilt. it's a damage spell.. and more!</i>
<div class="t 3656"><i>- the mobs associated with conjure elemental are better.</i></div>
<i>- Druid damage spells will no longer frag items.</i>
<i>- Druid damage spells can now be cast anywhere, except tornado underwater.</i>
<i>- A lot of spells have changed circles.</i>

<i>DRUID SKILLS:</i>
<i>- commune with nature can be used anywhere, helps with concentration and</i>
<i>  other stuff.</i>
<i>- reclaim land makes things better for everyone.</i>

<i>BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!</i>

<i>- Dark knights will always follow the path of evil, but remain lawful.</i>
<i>- There are a bunch of new zones in the game. More are coming soon.</i>
<i>- We'll tell you about them later.</i>
<i>- A great number of changes were made to casting level items, mostly positive.</i>
<i>- A great number of changes were made to decay timers on a lot of items.</i>
<i>- Class sets are very different, we will post new stats on the forum for you.</i>
<i>- Other stuff, but let's get on with it.</i>

<i>We can thank people later, they know who they are, you probably do too.</i>
<i>There are some very strong dragons waiting to eat you.</i>

<i>Have a good wipe.</i>

<i>   You have been deleted.</i>
<i>   Thank you for playing.</i>

<i>   The game is still currently locked to all mortals and will remain</i>
<i>   locked until Friday, August 31 at 11PM UTC.</i>

<i>   We are hard at work getting as many changes done as we can during</i>
<i>   the downtime and a full list will be posted before we open back up</i>
<i>   again. In the meantime, here are some changes that we are ready to</i>
<i>   tell you about:</i>

<i>   SPELLS:</i>

<i>- The load locations of most druid spells have been changed.</i>
<i>- The red robe spell 'astral locate' has been removed from the game.</i>
<i>- The regular locate object spell remains!</i>
<i>- The cleric spell 'flamestrike' is now fourth circle instead of fifth.</i>


<i>   SKILLS:</i>

<i>- Shamans will have fewer spirits to manage. Sorry, not sorry.</i>
<i>- Barbarians are now a little better at using two-handed weapons.</i>
<i>- Barbarians now have the 'target' skill, for all the good it will do them.</i>
<i>- All casters got a little better at brewing, all but shamans at scribing.</i>
<i>- Clerics and druids took some bandaging lessons from shamans.</i>
<i>- Clerics and druids took some melee combat lessons as well.</i>
<i>- Shamans seemed to have skipped these lessons, they didn't need them.</i>


<i>   CLASSES:</i>

<i>  - A more thorough post regarding changes to druids will follow soon.</i>
<i>  - Hitpoints for casters were fiddled with ever so slightly.</i>
<i>  - The shaman guildmaster in Port Balifor found a space on Guild Road.</i>


<i>   DRAGONS:</i>

<i>- Dragons are scary again, and they are many. Be cautious, we recommend it.</i>
<i>- The thing we mentioned about dragons is for real, you should be afraid.</i>
<i>- You remember dragons, right? Well they are mostly a lot more dangerous.</i>
<i>- If thinking about dragons has you excited, you are wrong. Tremble.</i>
<i>- We added more dragons to the game, we upgraded several, we removed some.</i>
<i>- All of the dragons we mentioned are very likely to be able to kill you.</i>


<i>   ITEMS:</i>

<i>   - A great many items have been modified in a number of ways. We</i>
<i>     leave these for you to discover for yourselves with just a few</i>
<i>     comments:</i>
<i>     -- Overall, weapon max damage has been lowered. In many cases,</i>
<i>        minimums (thereby averages) are actually higher. A</i>
<i>        compromise. Only the best weapons were strongly affected.</i>
<i>     -- The percentage bonuses to damage done are no longer in use on</i>
<i>        items. Look for more shiny damroll in its place in most</i>
<i>        cases.</i>
<i>     -- The percentage bonuses to healing done/healing received have</i>
<i>        been lowered overall, but there's more of it.. so,</i>
<i>        compromise.</i>
<i>     -- Some percentage based regeneration bonuses have been changed,</i>
<i>        up and down.</i>
<i>     -- The percentage based bonuses to extra_attack have been</i>
<i>        reduced overall. It was well out of hand.</i>

<i>   Stay tuned for more and we'll see you soon!</i>

<i>   Chaos has begun to seep into the world. The harbingers of chaos</i>
<i>   wander the lands of mortals, bringing death and destruction with</i>
<i>   incredible and almost ridiciulous rewards in exchange.</i>

<i>   From this point forward we kindly ask that players refrain from</i>
<i>   venturing into zones with which they are not familiar or that are</i>
<i>   high level. To be plain: there should be no exploring or high</i>
<i>   level zoning now that we have entered the last days of the wipe.</i>

<i>   Violations of this kind request will be met with a personal pwipe.</i>

<i>     Enjoy the end, my friends.</i>

<i>     - Kam</i>


<i>August 10, 2018</i>

<i>         (This is the pwipe announcement you've been waiting for.)</i>



<i>   On Monday, August 27th at 6AM UTC (system time) you will all be</i>
<i>   deleted.</i>

<div class="t 3844"><i>   The game will remain locked to mortals until Friday, August 31st</i></div>
<i>   at 11PM UTC.</i>

<i>   A larger post with the details of the terrible things we've been</i>
<i>   up to will follow in the coming weeks, but we wanted to provide</i>
<i>   this announcement now so that you all have time to quit your jobs,</i>
<i>   go AWOL, drop out of school or leave your husbands, wives and</i>
<i>   children behind.</i>

<i>     There are some things you should know so that you can plan</i>
<i>     appropriately:</i>

<i>     - PK damage will remain at 60% for now, maybe forever.</i>
<i>     - The rules regarding multiple characters from one connection</i>
<i>       will change as follows: TWO (2) characters will be allowed per</i>
<i>       IP provided that both characters have matching e-mail</i>
<i>       addresses associated with them. Attempts to circumvent this</i>
<i>       rule will be met with immediate deletion, no question.</i>
<i>     - Character sharing is still very much against the rules.</i>
<i>     - Druids will suck less.</i>
<i>     - Class item sets will be very different.</i>

<i>   Again, more details on these things and much more news to come,</i>
<i>   stay tuned.</i>

<i>   Also, as ever, we expect you all to turn muderous and bloodthirsty</i>
<i>   to herald the end of the wipe but we ask that you wait until we're</i>
<i>   a bit closer to the day (ideally until Friday, August 24th) before</i>
<i>   starting in on one another. There will not be any of the usual</i>
<i>   enhancements supplied until then and asking beforehand will likely</i>
<i>   end with a personal pwipe just for you.</i>

<i>Thanks for playing.</i>

<i>    Kam is now the GIMP (Game-Implementor). That means he is in charge of</i>

<i>   - The barbarian guildmaster in Kalaman has moved on and a new</i>
<i>   tavern - The Powder Keg - has opened. Its proprietor, Myte Luze,</i>
<i>   is a friend whom we've all been missing in the game since August</i>
<i>   21, 2017 when he was lost to us. If there are any suggestions to</i>

<i>      - Magnus ver Magnusson has returned from his vacation.</i>
<i>      - A new pier has been constructed in the Kalaman Dockyards.</i>

<i>      Oh, we changed PK damage to 60% back in December but forgot (on</i>
<i>   purpose) to tell you. I am a kender, it is in my nature to be</i>
<i>   sneaky.</i>
<i>      We tested this at a lot of different levels and found that 60%</i>
<i>   seems to be the sweet spot. PK is completely viable but the damage</i>
<i>   is limited enough that you won't be getting jacked in one round</i>
<i>   (probably) anymore, which should make for a more interesting time</i>
<i>   that actually requires some of the talent, skill and sass that we</i>
<i>   remember from the people who were actually good at PK back in the</i>
<i>   day.</i>
<i>   As ever, subject to constant change if things get out of hand!</i>
<i>   May you all die.</i>

<div class="t 4063"></div>
<i>      We have a number of projects currently underway that we felt it</i>
<i>   would be good to give everyone an update on. I'll let you read</i>
<i>   that stuff first so you can skip all the words at the end if you</i>
<i>   like.</i>

<i>     New zones coming soon:</i>
<i>      Ancient Labyrinth             (high)       Kholos</i>
<i>      Neraka: Blue Dragonarmy Camp  (mid-high)   Flair</i>
<i>      Forest of Wayreth             (low)        Dandalf</i>

<i>    New rebuilds coming soon:</i>
<i>      Woods of Lahue (Pigmy Forest) (mid-high)   Rinad</i>
<i>      Isle of Shadows               (high)       Kholos and Kam</i>

<i>    New expansions coming soon:</i>
<i>      Balifor Underbelly            (low-mid)    Kam and Anista</i>
<i>      Balifor Dockyards             (low-mid)    Kam</i>
<i>      Thieves' Cove                 (mid-high)   Kam</i>

<i>    Other updates across various zones, more details to come:</i>
<i>    - Dragons will be more dragon-like. The weak dragons especially.</i>
<i>    - There will be some new dragons in the world.</i>
<i>    - Generally we recommend being afraid of dragons. They are scary.</i>
<i>    - Kender can be any class and will roll straight 28s for stats. (TBD)</i>

<i>      We currently do not have a date in mind for the next playerwipe</i>
<i>   to occur but once we're able to complete these and all the other</i>
<i>   changes I'm not telling you about, we will set a firm date.</i>

<i>      At the moment we only have myself (Kam) and Flook to handle the</i>
<i>   normal operation of the game and the creation port. We are very</i>
<i>   lucky to have a new group of immortals interested in creation and</i>
<i>   working hard on a number of zones for us all, as well Sanjuro who</i>
<i>   is still making time to try to kill you all with his next project.</i>

<i>      We'd like to thank everyone for playing, those who've stuck</i>
<i>   around and those who've come back (and even some of those who have</i>
<i>   stayed away). It takes a lot of work to keep this thing running</i>
<i>   and we're happy to do it for you all. We hope you'll be able to</i>
<i>   keep up the patience as we crawl into the future together.</i>

<i>      - Blindness Sigil back to its original name. Thanks Adepali</i>
<i>        for fixing the underlying problem.</i>

<i>      - Flook</i>

<i>November 1, 2017</i>

<i>      - Blindness Sigil renamed to Cause Blindness</i>
<i>        This should fix an issue related to erasing blindness immunity.</i>

<i>      - Flook</i>

<i>September 27, 2017</i>

<i>      - PK damage has been increased to 25%. May you all die.</i>
<i>        As ever, this may be subject to change in the future.</i>

<i>      - Kam and Flook are to blame.</i>

<i>September 15, 2017</i>

<i>      - There are now much better places to rest located within one</i>
<i>   to two rooms of most major receptions throughout the game. Rest</i>
<i>   easy, dear travellers.</i>

<i>      - There was a shaman guildmaster's conference held yesterday in</i>
<i>   which all agreed to teach the same curriculum. There is rumored to</i>
<i>   be one exception.</i>

<i>    As the Dragonarmies engulf all of Krynn in war, the reclusive dwarves</i>

<i>June 17, 2017 -- New Wipe</i>

<i>   Welcome to a new wipe of Arctic MUD! Below is the list of changes.</i>

<i>   General Race & Class Changes:</i>
<i>   - Gnomes racial bonus changed from spell power to spell damage.</i>
<i>   - Ice storm spell now focuses.</i>
<i>   - Mage area spell loading has been changed.</i>
<i>   - Shadow Wrap spell was readded.</i>
<i>   - Astral locator spell was readded.</i>
<i>   - Delayed Blast Fireball spell was readded.</i>

<i>   World Changes</i>
<i>   - Qualinesti has received a complete revamp.</i>
<i>   - Tantallon has been added back into the game.</i>
<i>   - Phaethon has been added back into the game.</i>
<i>   - Enstar's Bay has been added back into the game.</i>
<i>   - A Green Dragonarmy camp has popped up near Neraka.</i>
<i>   - A Black Dragonarmy camp has popped up near Neraka.</i>
<div class="t 4110"><i>   - All rentable items from Thorbardin are now NORENT.</i></div>

<i>   The Thorbardin items being changed to NORENT is due to the fact that </i>
<i>   a full revamp may be ready some time soonish, and players having items</i>
<i>   rented may cause complications.</i>

<i>   Huge thanks to Alecto, without him Qualinesti wouldn't be finished.</i>
<i>   Big thanks to Rorc for all your efforts in the last week.</i>
<i>   Big thanks to Wratha for rescuing Tantallon, Phaethon and Enstar's.</i>
<i>   Thanks go to Horton and Kragg for the dragonarmy camps.</i>

<i>   We hope you enjoy the wipe.</i>

<i>   wipe the player base.</i>


<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 4297"><i>   Arctic will be locked to players for a while for us to make changes.</i></div>

<i>   Currently, the game is scheduled to be opened to players on Saturday,</i>

<i>   We may need to delay this a couple of hours depending on the</i>

<i>      There have been some personnel changes in the Fish Market of</i>
<i>   Port Balifor. Somehow the Dragonarmies managed to maintain a</i>

<i>   done for the game but we really can't think of anything at the</i>
<i>   moment.</i>

<i>   A dispatch from Lucky O'Sullivan, famed hero:</i>
<i>          There's leprechauns about! They've stolen me</i>
<i>        rainbow, busted into pieces by their foul magicks</i>
<i>        and now carried about by these devilish fiends!</i>
<i>        Help me to retrieve the pieces, keep them safe and</i>
<i>        seek me out for rewards in the coming time.</i>

<i>      There are a few different leprechauns to be found in the world,</i>
<i>   some more hardy than others but all formidible in their own right.</i>
<i>   Being level 30 or close is advisable, and groups are encouraged</i>
<i>   lest you'd prefer the streets to run with your own blood rather</i>

<i>      There comes a time in every cleric's life when the world seems</i>
<i>   to change sharply and everything you once knew is no longer the</i>
<i>   same. This is that time for you, dear fellows, for a great and</i>
<i>   powerful force has descended upon the land of Arctic and</i>
<i>   eradicated all of the prayerbooks that your kind had once coveted,</i>
<i>   held dear and constantly quested after. This handsome demon is of</i>
<i>   course the one and only Kam. A kender like no other, with so much</i>
<i>   power and such rugged good looks that it's a marvel even to behold</i>
<i>   his presence at all.</i>

<i>      Fear not, however, for in his infinite wisdom he has spent</i>
<i>   great effort and time to write a new catalog of prayerbooks,</i>
<i>   obviously much improved and far superior to the crumbling relics</i>
<i>   of days past.</i>

<i>      Everything you know about cleric prayerbooks is wrong.</i>

<i>      Those that were are now gone, and new ones stand in their</i>
<i>   place. While some load locations remain the same, the spells found</i>
<i>   there may differ. Additionally, a couple of spells that found</i>
<i>   their way into the hands of guildmasters have been returned to the</i>
<i>   exclusive domain of prayerbooks.</i>

<i>   Your favorite,</i>

<i>As more merchants realise the potential of the enchantment frenzy, the</i>
<i>quality of scrolls of drain magic improves and the price plummets.</i>

<i>October 26th, 2016</i>

<i>The head of the Conclave of Mages was awoken by a frantic knocking at the</i>
<i>door to his chamber. With a frustrated wave of the hand, the wizard opened</i>
<i>the door, preparing to berate whichever apprentice it was that had the</i>
<i>tenacity to disturb him at this hour. To his shock, he saw that it was one</i>
<i>of his closest friends and allies, a senior mage of the red robes who had</i>
<i>been missing for several months after embarking in search of an artifact</i>
<i>that would let him gaze into the future.</i>

<i>The red robe stared at him with a look of fright and horror, before</i>
<i>stuttering in an attempt to explain the source of his terror. "Master... I</i>
<i>saw... it is true... the future... no magic..." The head of the Conclave</i>
<i>conjured a glass of elven wine, and motioned for his friend to sit down.</i>
<i>After draining the glass of its contents, the red robe continued with his</i>
<i>tale.</i>

<i>He told of a vision of a barren land, a Krynn devoid of all magic.</i>
<i>Once-mighty mages cowered, powerless, behind warriors and barbarians, whose</i>
<i>blades now decided the fate of the world. Towers of High Sorcery lay</i>
<i>derelict, home to rodents and other, less savoury, creatures. Spellbooks</i>
<i>which once held secrets to almost unfathomable power lay abandoned, useless</i>
<i>in a world no longer watched over by the gods of magic. The red robe could</i>
<i>not determine for sure how far into the future the vision was set, but</i>
<i>there were clues that it was not long in the measures of time used by</i>
<i>mages, certainly less than a millennium and possibly even less than a</i>
<i>century.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 4547"></div>
<i>When these findings were announced to the senior members of the Conclave,</i>
<i>the thought of a world without magic struck terror into the hearts of</i>
<i>wizards of all robes, and so they began to make preparations for this</i>
<i>eventuality, should it ever come to pass. If magic from the gods could not</i>
<i>be relied upon, wizards would require other, more physical, reserves from</i>
<i>which to draw power.</i>

<i>For years the wizards toiled, devising ingenious methods for draining the</i>
<i>power from magical items and artifacts, condensing the magic into a</i>
<i>physical manifestation which could be stored in vaults within the Tower of</i>
<i>High Sorcery for later use. Should the need arise, they could use this</i>
<i>condensed magic to imbue new items with whatever powers and enchantments</i>
<i>were needed to defend themselves.</i>

<i>Before long the wizards began to form a stockpile of condensed magic, ready</i>
<i>for use should their god-given power one day be taken from them. But alas,</i>
<i>enchanting new items with the stored magic proved much more difficult. Many</i>
<i>ingenious concepts were tried, but even those that seemed promising failed</i>
<i>at the final hurdle, the magic repelling itself from the item and</i>
<i>condensing back into physical form.</i>

<i>They were close to abandoning hope, when the head of the black robes</i>
<i>emerged from her chamber, visibly weak and drained, after months in</i>
<i>isolation. Though her body seemed weaker, her robes gleamed with newfound</i>
<i>arcane power. She had discovered the secret to enchanting items with</i>
<i>condensed magic, a ghastly process which used the energy of her own soul to</i>
<i>bind the item to her, creating a conduit of power so strong that the magic</i>
<i>could no longer resist being channelled into the item. She would not speak</i>
<i>of the deeds she carried out at the item's behest to build a bond strong</i>
<i>enough to accept the powerful magics she wished to imbue. But the Conclave</i>
<i>had their answer at last and, with it, a plan to safeguard their power for</i>
<i>the eons ahead.</i>

<i>==============================================================================</i>

<i>Or, our new enchantment system is ready. See HELP ATTUNEMENT and HELP</i>
<i>ENCHANTMENT to get started.</i>

<i>Our main objective with this system is to provide exciting long-term goals </i>
<i>for more casual solo players and small groups. As it is a major new feature,</i>
<i>expect several changes while we tweak it for better balance. Please submit </i>
<i>your feedback on the forum.</i>

<i>Outside the Tower of Wayreth, Mistress Jenna in Palanthas was the first to</i>
<i>realize the business opportunities provided by the newfound art of enchanting.</i>
<i>Besides selling the necessary parafernalia, she has instructed her new </i>
<i>assistant, Rupert, in the arcane mysteries of sigil creation.</i>

<i>Robed mages should visit their guildmaster in Wayreth to learn the drain magic </i>
<i>spell. The less magically inclined can purchase scrolls of drain magic from </i>
<i>Jenna's shop.</i>

<i>NOTE: There is currently a single attunable item in the game: a plain silver</i>
<i>ring, sold by Jenna. Players can only attune and wear a single such ring.</i>
<i>Jenna will not refund greedy customers.</i>

<i>Many thanks to all imms and mortals who helped with the testing and the setup</i>

<i>October 20th, 2016 -- Everyone feels enlightened?!</i>

<i>     One of the most common complaints that players have had recently was</i>
<i>regarding the difficulty in raising particular skills to superb. The</i>
<i>trouble stemmed from the original code never anticipating a system where</i>
<i>every character would need to max out every skill. The first 85% of the</i>
<i>way was reasonably balanced, and the last 15% was very much dependant on</i>
<i>luck.</i>

<i>     The solution needed to be better than "make it easier to skill up"</i>
<i>because we do not want to reward bot-like behavior, or force people to</i>
<i>gear or rank in a particular way just to skill up. Arctic players are a</i>
<i>combination of both extremely observant and extremely superstitious which</i>
<i>left us in a position where we would see warriors with +learn,</i>
<i>intelligence and wisdom ranks as that was the 'only way' they would ever</i>
<i>see superb skills. We want players to train their skills by killing</i>
<i>digital monsters, not wearing class inappropriate gear and praying in</i>
<i>their guilds for hours at a time.</i>

<i>     To that end, skill training has been reworked. It should now be much</i>
<i>easier to train your skills during normal zoning, especially those that</i>
<i>have traditionally been very hard to raise. The effectiveness of the</i>
<i>things that would logically affect a persons ability to learn a skill have</i>
<i>been improved overall. On the other hand, botting (which is still</i>

<i>September 28th, 2016 -- Which Imm is leveling a Mage?!</i>

<i>There have been a couple changes/fixes for mages. </i>

<i>name <mob> <name> - The name pet cooldown has been lowered from 10080 to</i>
<i>90. (There should be a different cooldown for each pet.) If you are locked</i>
<i>in to the old 10000 tick cooldown, catch a 35+ online and we can probably</i>
<i>work out how to fix it for you.</i>

<i>name <mob> reset - This will now properly check to make sure you should be</i>
<i>able to name the pet before it allows you to remove the name.</i>

<i>The skill conjure is now acquired by mages at level 20 instead of 25.</i>
<i>There was some debate if this would make mages overpowered in pk at level</i>
<i>20, so if you like this change, try to refrain from making a group of 8</i>
<i>level 20 mages and killing everyone on sight.</i>

<i>A good number of the changes/fixes that have been implemented recently</i>
<i>have come from players posting on the forums, or using the idea (help</i>

<i>We have tweaked the way rank information is displayed. You no longer need</i>

<i>When a character is level 3-9, and they proceed to the main login menu,</i>

<i>6) Reroll this character.</i>

<i>Selecting this option will allow you to reset your character to level 1.</i>
<i>You will retain all of your equipment and money, but will lose all other</i>
<i>progress on the character. If you have lored the character (or potion of</i>
<i>knowledge etc) you will be presented with a list of your ability scores</i>
<i>and have the option to select one to lock in for your next roll.</i>

<i>If you havn't lored, you can still reroll, but it will not give you the</i>
<i>option to lock a particular ability score.</i>

<i>If you run into any issues, or have any other suggestions for this</i>

<i>January 26th, 2016 Mud Updates</i>

<i>The group size limit has been set to 10 players. The overall goal of</i>
<i>the reduction in group size was to reduce group power in zones and</i>
<i>allow zones to be completed with less players when they were not</i>
<i>available. I appreciate the constructive feedback we received from</i>
<i>players, and while we did see an overall decrease in group power, we</i>
<i>did not intend for players to have to sit on the bench instead of</i>
<i>enjoy the game with their friends.</i>

<i>This change will require some additional balancing and we will</i>
<i>continue to monitor group balance as we move forward.</i>

<i>Some minor updates that are also included:</i>
<i>* attribute bonuses from legendary status have been decreased</i>
<i>* nightmare made easier to save against</i>
<i>* item set attributes have been reduced</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>January 23rd, 2016 - Strength Update</i>

<i>As a part of the melee balance pass, we have updated the strength</i>
<i>attribute. Many of the weapons have already been updated to align with</i>
<i>this change, and we hope to have the remainder of weapons updated</i>
<i>soon.</i>

<i>Strength affects how heavy a weapon you can wield:</i>
<i>Primary: You can wield a primary weapon that has the same weight as</i>
<i>your strength attribute.</i>
<i>Secondary: You can wield a secondary weapon that has half the</i>
<i>weight of your strength attribute.</i>
<i>Two-handed: You can wield a two-handed weapon that has twice the</i>
<i>weight of your strength attribute.</i>

<i>Example:</i>

<i>Scrappinak the Male Gnome Warrior has 20 STR.</i>
<i>He can wield a primary weapon that weighs 20, offhand a weapon that</i>
<i>weighs 10 and two-hand a weapon that weighs 40.</i>

<i>Other notes:</i>
<i>* reduced healing_factor given by legendary tenacious heart</i>
<i>* reduced limit_damage_factor of legendary ghostdance</i>
<i>* updated primal fury to give more of a bonus to spell casters</i>
<i>* damage from shoot has been reduced</i>
<i>* punch damage reduced</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>January 13th, 2016 - Melee Balance Update</i>

<i>We have been looking at power balance throughout the mud and wanted to</i>
<i>provide this update as we start our first balance passes focused on</i>
<i>melee gear.</i>

<i>These balancing passes are intended to place equipment into better</i>
<i>alignment with the game's internal mechanics. With these changes, we</i>
<i>hope to provide melee characters multiple paths to success, while</i>
<i>removing some of the absolute power that damroll items have. To</i>
<i>support this, we will be restricting certain affects such as strength</i>
<i>and damroll to the same wear locations. This change should create some</i>
<i>competition between those stats, add value to strength items and not</i>
<i>allow for it to be super easy to be a +25 damage character with 28</i>
<i>strength.</i>

<i>In addition to equipment changes mentioned above, weapons will also</i>
<i>receive some balancing in the weight and damage dice areas. The mean</i>
<i>weapon damage done by all weapons will be reduced and some weapons</i>
<i>might be placed in lower or higher brackets than before. High end</i>
<i>melee players will still hit hard in comparison, however the gap</i>
<i>between should become more approachable. This change also allows the</i>
<i>Again, I appreciate the thoughtful feedback that we receive from</i>
<i>players and look forward to having discussions. After we complete the</i>
<i>melee balancing, we will start with you mangy spell casters.</i>

<i>January 2nd, 2016 - legendary update</i>

<i>Some healing improvements have been made to legendary cleric and druid</i>
<i>classes.</i>

<i>Cleric:</i>
<i>Legendary strength of one rank has been replaced by legendary healing</i>
<i>mist. Legendary healing mist adds increased duration to the spell and</i>
<i>increases the chance healing mist will occur. Players that already</i>
<i>have the strength of one rank will automatically receive the healing</i>
<i>mist rank.</i>

<i>Druid:</i>
<i>Legendary healing cloud rank has been updated. The second cloud from</i>
<i>healing cloud has been removed and replaced with a 100% chance for</i>
<i>healing cloud to occur.</i>

<i>December 27th, 2015</i>

<i>Dargonesti can now join any of the Orders of High Sorcery.</i>

<i>December 18th, 2015</i>

<i>The weapon skill requirement for legendary has been fixed.</i>

<i>December 17th, 2015 - Healing Update</i>

<i>The effectiveness of the 'heal' spell and lay skill have been slightly reduced.</i>
<i>We will continue to monitor the healing system and make adjustments as needed.</i>

<i>p.s. Working out another issue with legendary and skill requirements.</i>

<i>December 16th, 2015 -- Paladin Quests & Legendary</i>

<i>November 25th, 2014 -- Rise Deletions</i>

<i>Regarding the deletion of a few RISE members:</i>

<i>    At the beginning of this wipe I spoke with Reed and discussed how with</i>
<i>a smaller player base the game could not support their members driving well</i>
<i>intended neutrals from the game. The conversations were positive and I had</i>
<i>a strong feeling that I would not have to get involved at all. Reed</i>
<i>understood that the RISE would be held to a more strict standard and we</i>
<i>ended the conversations amicably. This went for a while, until we again</i>
<i>started seeing casual players being pkilled for <insert whatever bullshit></i>

<i>At this point we realized that as a smaller player based game, we are</i>
<div class="t 5110"><i>seeing 2-4 players quit over this each wipe as they are attacked by the</i></div>
<i>same 2-3 players. It was with the best interest of the game that we decided</i>

<i>Rent Changes:</i>
<i>-The number of places you are able to rent has been drastically reduced.</i>
<i>  Players can now only rent in the following locations: Solace, Tarsis,</i>
<i>  Balifor, Kalaman, Neraka, Palanthas and established clan inns.</i>
<i>-The cost of renting in a clan inn has been increased. Clan inns are now</i>
<i>  more expensive to rent in than major cities. #clantax</i>

<i>Race Updates:</i>
<i>  A brief refresh of the races was completed. Racial bonuses have been</i>
<i>added to the help files e.g. HELP RACE HUMAN will now show what racial</i>
<i>bonus they receive. Racial bonuses have been adjusted to never be offensive</i>
<i>or directly PvP related (things like bash_mod and +damage were removed). In</i>
<i>addition to racial bonuses, the stats for races have also been slightly</i>
<i>adjusted. You should find it easier to roll in playable range than before.</i>


<i>Class Updates:</i>
<i>-Paladins can only be of Human of Half-Elf races.</i>
<i>-Dark Knights can only be of Human or Half-Elf races.</i>


<i>Items Sets have been a thorn in my side for several wipes now, always a</i>
<i>mish-mash of random junk and haphazardly balanced vs. other gear. I think</i>
<i>we hit a good spot last wipe with the druid set so we expanded from there.</i>
<i>The new item sets should be 'good' enough so that a player will want to</i>
<i>maintain them, but not too 'good'. At some point in a players career they</i>
<i>will have to make a choice to break the set to replace it with better gear.</i>
<i>Each set will allow for a minor and major set bonus, the minor requires 4</i>
<i>pieces to be worn and the major requires all 6. We really do hope that you</i>
<i>enjoy the new sets and learning where they load.</i>

<i>There are a number of various tweaks and changes that we are not going to</i>
<i>divulge, we leave these for you to find and complain/rave about at your</i>
<i>leisure.</i>

<i>Finally, I wanted to offer special thanks to the creation staff. It has</i>

<i>As a final note, I urge all of you to play Arctic responsibly and respect</i>

<i>October 31st, 2013 - Player Wipe Date Announced</i>

<i>    We are trying something new this time around. We are going to announce</i>
<i>the player wipe well in advance, giving people plenty of time to plan their</i>
<i>lives around it. We are also going to make very few changes for the wipe,</i>
<i>not zero changes, but very limited.</i>

<i>    The game will be shutting down sometime on Thursday, December 5th, 2013</i>
<i>for the player wipe. The exact time it will be shutdown is not set yet, but</i>
<i>it will probably be during the morning server time.</i>

<i>    The game will re-open for the new player wipe on Friday, December 6th,</i>
<i>2013 at 4pm server time (MST).</i>

<i>    Do with this information what you will.</i>

<i>October 20th, 2013 - Looking Forward</i>

<i>State of the Mud Address</i>
<i>http://arcticmud.org/forums/index.php/topic,386.0.html</i>


<i>   Thank you all for taking the time to read this long winded thread. I</i>
<i>hope that through this post I can shed some light on the direction of the</i>
<i>mud, timing, pwipes and new features and changes on the horizon.</i>

<i>   Arctic has always been a great game, the combination of sandbox style</i>
<i>development coupled with the dynamic content generated by the players</i>
<i>keeps us coming back for more. We all have our faults and I know we</i>
<i>haven't always seen eye to eye, but I hope that we can all bury whatever</i>
<i>hatchets we have and move the game forward.</i>

<i>   Class Design: I wanted to set the stage and shine a little light into</i>
<i>the future of classes by divulging some information about class design.</i>
<i>Over the next few wipes we will be redesigning each class from the ground</i>
<i>up. Nothing is on or off the table at this point but the guiding</i>
<i>philosophy will be to give most classes the ability to fill multiple</i>
<i>roles.</i>
<i>   We will be keeping the holy trinity around, Tanking, Healing and Damage</i>
<i>but we want players to be able to do more with less. A Warrior for</i>
<i>example, could become a great tank or swap and do some needed damage, a</i>
<i>Druid could easily play main healer and switch to damage when needed. We</i>
<i>want the combinations to make sense and be more balanced for smaller</i>
<i>groups, not being able to run a zone because you dont have a Barbarian or</i>
<i>have a 14+ heal Cleric online is something we want to get away from. We</i>
<i>hope to have enough uniqueness in each class that you can select something</i>
<i>that fits your gameplay without making each role generic and bland.</i>
<div class="t 5578"></div>
<i>   A while back we posted that one class most likely would not make the</i>
<i>cut in the next wipe. That class is the Scout. I won't go into any</i>
<i>specifics other than the class did not play well with the current</i>
<i>mechanics and vision we have for the class. The Scout will be replaced by</i>
<i>a completely overhauled Ranger class and we will release more about the</i>
<i>class when we have the design in a more finalized state. Mechanics: To</i>
<i>accomplish the class design we will be implementing several new game</i>
<i>mechanics. The first of these new mechanics is something we call 'weapon</i>
<i>attack skills'. The skill 'long blades' is pretty boring so we are</i>
<i>creating a mechanic to add some life and variety to gameplay. Weapon</i>
<i>attack skills are new skills that use the weapon class (piercers,</i>
<i>bludgeon, etc...) of the wielded weapon to perform different types of</i>
<i>attacks. The weapon attack skills have 3 different types, a basic attack,</i>
<i>an affect attack which adds different affects onto the target and a</i>
<i>finisher attack. The basic and affect attack can be used to unlock the</i>
<i>finishing attack. In order to have the system effectively, we collapsed</i>
<i>the 'long blade' and 'short blade' into a single 'swords' class. This</i>
<i>change means some short blades were moved into the piercers category. The</i>
<i>two-handed skill was completely removed and the weapons were placed into</i>
<i>the appropriate class.</i>

<i>   We are also building a new mechanic to handle affects both positive and</i>
<i>negative that occur as a result of a skill or spell. Our goal with this</i>
<i>mechanic is to allow for 'crowd control' type affects to work more of the</i>
<i>time but limit stacking/overuse of them. We are spreading crowd control</i>
<i>abilities and leveling the playing field so that more classes can perform</i>
<i>them. Our hope is that players won't always need a Warrior to bash because</i>
<i>a similar crowd control affect can be delivered by another class. We are</i>
<i>deep into the design of this system so I won't disclose to much but we are</i>
<i>trying to keep the mechanic balanced so that it affects players and mobs</i>
<i>the same way. Our focus is to keep the mechanics the same between PvP and</i>
<i>PvE. Some quick highlights on other mechanics that will be making their</i>
<i>way into the game:</i>
<i>  1. Hit point normalization: classes will have more of an equal base hp</i>
<i>  2. Mages will become more gear dependent and the casting_level affect</i>
<i> will be removed</i>
<i>  3. Possible XP table changes. Don't get your hopes too high as we</i>
<i> honestly think the tables were fairly close to where we wanted them but</i>
<i> we have received the feedback from you and want to seriously evaluate</i>
<i> some changes there.</i>

<i>   Zones: The next wipe will bring a complete rewrite of an old zone. I</i>
<i>hope that I can do as good as a job as Sanjuro has done with Dargaard and</i>
<i>we hope that we can keep refreshing old content for you to explore. Our</i>
<i>goal is to redesign older zones more to the Dragonlance theme in the War</i>
<i>of the Lance timeline. We will be starting with the core zones and moving</i>
<i>out from there. This of course, is a long project and will take the</i>
<i>longest but we will strive to keep fresh content coming in each wipe in</i>
<i>some shape or another.</i>

<i>   Pwipe: A pwipe is coming, the unknown is exactly when. A lot of code</i>
<i>and a lot of creation changes need to be made before we can pwipe and the</i>
<i>timing of that is just too much in flux to be able to lock down a date. We</i>
<i>are open to listening to arguments for a wipe just to wipe, but aren't</i>
<i>sold that it is a great idea.</i>

<i>July 19th, 2013 -- Creation Update</i>

<i>Despair spread through Kalaman this morning when it was discovered that</i>
<i>Laurana, the Golden General, was abducted last night by forces loyal to</i>
<i>Kitiara, the Blue Lady. According to scout reports, she has been taken to</i>
<i>nearby Dargaard Keep where she is currently being held. A company of</i>
<i>Solamnic Knights mounted an attack on Dargaard Keep, but apparently they</i>
<i>have not been heard from since they left the city.</i>

<i>TL|DR Version:</i>
<i>A new (hopefully more fun) version of Dargaard Keep has been created by</i>
<i>Sanjuro and is now ready for play. Items that are rented from the previous</i>
<i>zone will remain in play until the item decays normally.</i>

<i>Many thanks to Sanjuro on his latest death-trap err, creation.</i>

<i>June 26th, 2013</i>

<i>    Due to an old, faulty script I ran this morning, all rentfiles of</i>
<i>players not logged in when I ran the script were lost. The only real</i>
<i>solution after that happened was to restore to the previous backup of ALL</i>
<i>rentfiles, which was from 4am system time today. That means some players</i>
<i>lost about 4 hours worth of equipment changes. There are a few players this</i>
<i>will hurt, a few others it will help, but most should be unaffected. Sorry</i>
<i>for any inconvience, but please remember our no reimbursment policy.</i>

<i>Experience Changes:</i>
<i>    At this point in a pwipe finding a low-level group is much harder, so a</i>
<i>change was made to the bonus experience system for grouping:</i>
<i>-Solo players will now recieve a large bonus to experience gained.</i>
<i>-The bonus experience for grouping was reduced slightly, only to simplify</i>
<i> the code around this bonus experience.</i>

<i>    There is another, slightly more interactive, change we can implement if</i>
<i>these measures are not enough of a boost. We are going to let this</i>
<i>automatic experience boost play out a bit before we try the other option.</i>

<i>    Expect this experience change to be reverted at the start of next wipe.</i>

<i>A New Day, A New Wipe, Same As It Ever Was</i>

<i>Welcome Everyone,</i>

<i>    I usually end these start of wipe posts with the thank you portion, but</i>
<i>I am going to start with it this time.</i>

<i>    The number of people that put work into this game has dwindled pretty</i>
<i>steadily over the years, so the few of us left have to work harder to keep</i>
<i>things afloat. The majority of the work during the wipe down time and every</i>
<i>other time has been done by Hoss (creation, the iron fist of justice,</i>
<i>keeping my stupid ideas in check), Sanjuro (creation) and Scrappinak (sys</i>
<i>admin). Without those 3 we would either be shutdown completely or I would</i>
<i>be running the game off one of my old cell phones. Thanks guys, you make</i>
<i>any effort I put in appear worthwhile.</i>

<i>    A few people contribute in minor ways from the immortal side, but</i>
<i>without them things would only get worse. Flook fills our get-crap-done</i>
<i>role, if there is an annoying task he is the one to carry the water.</i>
<i>Starmis is our de-facto webmaster. Flair tries to assist where he can, but</i>
<i>we mock him more often than not. There are lots of other people over the</i>
<i>years, too many to name, so I am just listing the people that have been</i>
<i>recently helping out.</i>

<i>    Next I want to thank YOU, the players. Without people using the game,</i>
<i>posting ideas, posting bug reports, shouting stupid stuff and killing</i>
<i>everything in sight, this game would be a pointless waste of space. If you</i>
<i>keep coming back, we will keep trying to improve the game and at a minimum</i>
<i>keep it up and running. Thanks.</i>

<i>    Specifically I want to thank all of the people who donated money to the</i>
<i>game. We are no longer running on free servers, and the cloud is definitely</i>
<i>not free. We have enough money on-hand at the moment to continue running</i>
<i>the game for another 3 to 4 years. Fully 50% of the donated amount was</i>
<i>given by one person. Another 25% was given by another person. Those 2</i>
<i>people are keeping the game up for you. If you know who they are, help them</i>
<i>gain some ranks or something because they are awesome.</i>

<i>    This new wipe is hopefully a transition for the game. We are still</i>
<i>working on Project Lube and hope to make the next wipe start on that</i>
<i>codebase, but it is a large project and we have other things going on in</i>
<i>our lives, so do not be upset if lube slips again (pun intended).</i>

<i>    With all the formalities out of the way, here is what you really wanted</i>
<i>out of this post the changes list. Enjoy,</i>


<i>General Changes:</i>
<i>-All new characters will start with 2 allowed domains.</i>
<i>-Position added to the prompt options (type: prompt position). Will show</i>
<i> your current position (sittings, resting, standing, sleeping).</i>
<i>-Reserve command added to inns (type: reserve).  Allows a player to </i>
<i> reset their rent location without leaving the game.</i>
<i>-LFG option added (type: opt lfg).  Will flag the player in the who list as </i>
<i> looking for a group.</i>
<i>-Who lfg  or who looking will list the players currently looking for a </i>
<i> group.</i>
<i>-Dynamic rank experience will regenerate faster and should cap out</i>
<i> higher on mobs that give it.</i>
<i>-Dynamic rank experience will be offered on some lower level mobs.</i>
<i>-Experience required to level for all levels increased, sometimes </i>
<i> significantly.</i>
<i>-Experience decay from killing the same thing over and over has been </i>
<i> made more lenient.</i>
<i>-Inspect command will now give a durability % at the end, indicating </i>
<i> how good condition is of the item.</i>
<i>-Pklog command added.  This will list all player kills that have happened </i>
<i> over the course of the entire wipe. Glory!</i>
<i>-Affects command added.  This will list the 'You are affected by the</i>
<i> following:' portion of the score command only.</i>
<i>-All new characters will start with a wrist lantern equipped.</i>
<i>-Skills that are ready for training with a guildmaster will be indicated in </i>
<i> the skills command with a ** next to them.</i>
<i>-The group command will list the guild abbreviation of each player (CL =</i>
<i> cleric, DA = dark knight, etc) at the start of the line. Quick, update</i>
<i> your heal scripts!</i>
<i>-Brew and Scribe skills will now fail if the user is feebleminded.</i>
<i>-Clanlist rank will show clans that have no rank experience (at the </i>
<i> bottom, obviously).</i>
<i>-Clan who will show the ranks of the characters.</i>
<i>-A message will be sent to your clan when you gain a level, gain a rank </i>
<i> or lose a level.</i>
<i>-The bandage skill was redone and should be slightly easier to train.</i>
<i>-A giant pile of small bugs and typos fixed. Thanks to everyone that</i>
<i> reported these, keep them coming.</i>
<i>-Lots of little additions, too many to name. Figure them out as you go.</i>

<i>Due to system upgrades that need to occur during the downtime, we will be</i>

<i>February 25th, 2013</i>

<i>I'll most likely delete you in the morning.</i>

<i>On Friday, March 1st (around Noon MST), the mud will close as we prepare for</i>
<i>a playerbase wipe. We currently plan to reopen the game for players</i>
<i>sometime on Friday, March 8th and we will update the forums when we are</i>
<i>closer to an exact time. During the next wipe Aristox and I will be</i>
<i>working on the lube project and will give more frequent updates on progress</i>
<i>and look for feedback on certain systems. The goal is to give players more</i>
<i>transparency on the changes that will be coming with the new project and</i>
<i>collect feedback and ideas from you.</i>

<i>I want to give a heartfelt thank you to all those that have donated to the</i>
<i>game, to date we have collected $1,034.00 USD which has covered the costs</i>
<i>of moving Arctic to a stable host and server. Only 20 percent of the</i>
<i>donations have been skimmed into our hookers and blow fund, so thank you</i>
<i>very much.</i>

<i>The player wipe is several days away, so feel free to keep playing, but</i>
<i>don't expect buffs or free gear. We may not hand them out at all, but if we</i>
<i>do it won't be until at least Thursday night.</i>

<i>January 30th, 2013 --Coffee is for closers</i>

<i>On January 28th, Arctic encountered a hard failure from which it could not</i>
<i>recover. Scrappinak has restored the game from a backup taken on January</i>
<i>24th. Due to the nature of doing a restore from backup, we will not be able</i>
<i>to reimburse any lost items/characters or such. I understand the</i>

<i>any inconvenience.</i>

<i>    Rumors swirl of an even greater evil lurking in the Turbidus Ocean that</i>
<i>is driving the sahuagin invasion, but no one who has gone to investigate</i>
<i>has ever returned ...</i>

<i>August 14th, 2012  ---  New Wipe, New Server, Same Arctic (mostly)  ---</i>


<i>    We cruelly deleted every player from the database, a full player wipe.</i>

<i>    With this wipe comes a new system and a new domain. While the</i>
<i>mud.arctic.org address will continue to work for the forseeable future, it</i>
<i>will become an alias for a new domain: arcticmud.org. The IP address of the</i>
<i>game will also change from 72.14.183.147 to 50.112.240.120. If you use</i>
<div class="t 6078"><i>"mud.arctic.org" to connect to the game, you should not have to change</i></div>
<i>anything.</i>

<i>    The forums on our website have also changed. We have transferred to a</i>
<i>new forum software and have not carried over any of the posts or users.</i>
<i>Please re-register if you wish to participate in any discussions on the</i>
<i>forums.</i>

<i>    We have added a DONATE button to the website and the new forums. If you</i>
<i>are so inclined, any contributions you can make to support the financial</i>
<i>costs of running this game would be much appreciated.</i>


<i>    Without more ado, here are the changes to the game you were probably</i>
<i>looking for in the first place.</i>

<i>General Changes:</i>
<i>-All item sets were reworked to be more consistent.</i>
<i>-Dragons should cast a couple new spells. Be wary.</i>
<i>-Lore/Identify on objects with certain special affects should give a more</i>
<i> clear indication of what those affects do.</i>

<i>Player Killing:</i>
<i>-Experience will now be awarded for killing players. There is a cap on how</i>
<i> much experience you can gain from killing another player. There is no</i>
<i> experience gained for killing a player 5 or more levels below your current</i>
<i> level.</i>

<i>Ranks:</i>
<i>-Rank experience can now be gained at any level.</i>
<i>-Ranks can now be purchased at any level.</i>
<i>-A new rank merchant (Chubby) has set up shop in Solace.</i>

<i>General Skills:</i>
<i>-Disarm should train more easily now.</i>
<i>-A successful shield block will reduce the damage taken for a short time.</i>
<i>This affect stacks, but only to a point.</i>
<i>-Scribe and Brew reuse timer reduced.</i>
<i>-Gift duration (and thus reuse duration) reduced for failures and</i>
<i> successes.</i>

<i>Barbarians:</i>
<i>-Hit point gains per level increased for Barbarians.</i>
<i>-Dargonesti can now be Barbarians.</i>

<i>[more] </i>
<i>-Mend cooldown reduced.</i>
<i>-Lore cooldown reduced.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 6328"><i>-Sharpen cooldown reduced.</i></div>
<i>-Battle Cry cooldown reduced.</i>

<i>Dark Knight:</i>
<i>-Inspire reuse timer reduced.</i>
<i>-Defensive Stance bonuses reduced a little.</i>
<i>-Defensive Impair nerfed a little.</i>
<i>-Dark Blessing duration reduced a little.</i>

<i>Druids:</i>
<i>-Commune with nature rewritten. Will work in non-natural rooms now and</i>
<i> cooldown reduced. The duration was reduced as well, but being able to use</i>
<i> it everywhere should make up for it.</i>

<i>Paladins:</i>
<i>-Cure Light added as a first circle spell.</i>
<i>-Restore Strength added as a second circle spell.</i>
<i>-Cure Serious added as a fourth circle spell.</i>
<i>-New Skill Added: Reckoning.  Available at level 10.</i>
<i>-Freedom rewritten. It is now a group version of the former spell and also</i>
<i> removes power word stun and nightmare from everybody.</i>
<i>-Divine intervention buffed. Heals more and the Paladin is set to 2 hps,</i>
<i> not -9 hps, after use.</i>

<i>Red Robes:</i>
<i>-Temporal Vision cooldown reduced and number of spells returned reduced.</i>

<i>Shamans:</i>
<i>-Field Medic should train more easily.</i>
<i>-Stupefy reuse timer reduced.</i>

<i>Warriors:</i>
<i>-Danger Sense should train more easily.</i>

<i>White Robes:</i>
<i>-Transference reuse timer reduced for successes and failures.</i>
<i>-Douse spell replaced with a new spell: Wane.</i>
<i>-Splintered Mind spell replaced with a new spell: Favorable Odds.</i>
<i>-Reignite spell replaced with a new spell: Castigate.</i>
<i>-Ignite initial damage increased.</i>
<i>-Cleanse has a 50% chance to remove power word stun and nightmare.</i>


<i>    That is it. There might be more tweaks and changes going forward, but</i>
<i>we want to see how these go for now.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>

<i>August 9th, 2012  ------- IMPORTANT NOTE, PLEASE READ THE WHOLE NEWS POST -------</i>

<div class="t 6375"><i>Topics: Server Move, Player Wipe and Domain Name Issues/Change</i></div>

<i>    All of the below is taking place sometime during the day on Tuesday,</i>
<i>August 14th, 2012. We are just telling you about it now.</i>

<i>Server Move</i>
<i>-----------</i>
<i>    We are moving Arctic off of our current host and into the Amazon Cloud</i>
<i>(EC2). The intent of this move is to gain more control of the server we are</i>
<i>running on for the people that are around day-to-day, and it should really</i>
<i>help our lag issues as a side bonus.</i>

<i>    I have personally thanked him, but I think everyone should take a</i>
<i>moment to thank Phred (Will) for hosting the game for the last several</i>
<i>years. Even after his availability to deal with everyday issues waned he</i>
<i>continued to allow this 20 year old game to occupy space in his world. It</i>
<i>is no stretch to say that if he had not stepped up and hosted for us Arctic</i>
<i>may have ceased to exist. Thank you Will.</i>

<i>    EC2 is by no means free, especially with the level of service Arctic</i>
<i>requires. Over the years some of the staff have put significant amounts of</i>
<i>money into running, support and marketing the game with no thought of</i>
<i>compensation. While we will continue to spend our money to keep things</i>
<i>running, we were hoping that some of you would consider donating to the</i>
<i>cause. Once the move to the new server is complete, we will have a DONATE</i>
<i>button on both the website and the forums that hooks into PayPal. There is</i>
<i>no requirement to donate (its a donation, duh), all money collected will go</i>
<i>toward paying for the EC2 instance, and no one will receive special</i>
<i>treatment for donating beyond the appreciation and thanks of the staff (and</i>
<i>hopefully other players). The game isn't going to go away because of lack</i>
<i>of funds, we were just hoping for a bit of help.</i>


<i>Player Wipe</i>
<i>-----------</i>
<i>    The current characters in the database are not making the move to the</i>
<i>new server. We decided that a player wipe now would be cleaner and provide</i>
<i>a fresh start for people on the new server. The LUBE Project is not</i>
<i>complete and will not be added at this point, it will come later. There are</i>
<i>some code changes going in with the wipe, some of which I think you will</i>
<i>really enjoy, but it is not nearly as many as in previous wipes.</i>

<i>    The player wipe is several days away, so feel free to keep playing, but</i>
<i>don't expect buffs or free gear. We may not hand them out at all, but if we</i>
<i>do it won't be until at least Monday night.</i>


<i>Domain Name Issues and Changes</i>
<i>------------------------------</i>
<i>    We do not own "arctic.org". It is owned by one of the founders of</i>
<i>Arctic (Dean Gaudet, aka Lazarus). He has to make changes to mud.arctic.org</i>
<i>for us to point it at EC2. The problem is we can't get a hold of Dean. This</i>
<i>server move has come together rather quickly (in the last week or so) and</i>
<i>Dean hasn't responded to any of our emails, facebook posts, linkedin posts,</i>
<i>etc. He may be on vacation, who knows. If anyone knows Dean, please try to</i>
<i>get a hold of him for us. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, try to get a hold of him</i>
<i>if you don't know him. We don't want to spam the poor guy.</i>

<i>    The case being what it currently is we aren't going to be able to use</i>
<i>mud.arctic.org until Dean blesses our changes, so we have a new domain to</i>
<i>use for time being if we need it. We will make that decision closer to</i>
<i>Tuesday and let people know the domain at that point.</i>

<i>    Hopefully Lazarus gets back to us before we need to do anything crazy.</i>



<i>In Summary:</i>
<i>-Pwipe and Server move on Tuesday, August 14th, 2012 (probably around</i>
<i> opening around 2pm CST).</i>
<i>-The lag should go away.</i>
<i>-The domain name for arctic may change for a short time. More on that</i>
<i> decision later.</i>
<i>-There will be some changes to guilds, spells and skills.</i>

<i>Side Note:</i>
<i>-LUBE is a giant project intend to make the game more enjoyable for</i>
<i> everyone. It will encompass a vast amount of changes to almost every</i>
<i> aspect of the game. It is a long term project and more details will be</i>
<i>plan.lable when things are more solidified with the </i>


<i>    Any questions can be directed to me via email (aristox@mud.arctic.org),</i>
<i>in game, or on the forums.</i>

<i>Thanks for your patience, hopefully this doesn't ruin your week,</i>

<i>April 30th, 2012</i>

<i>    Due to some over-zealous zone deletion by a certain creation guy (read:</i>
<i>Hoss), the dragon orbs in the game were causing game port to foom.</i>

<i>    Rather than leave the spec in where it tries to transfer the player to</i>
<i>a room for whatever reason, I removed all of that and went old school.</i>

<i>    As of now, when equipping a dragon orb you will be set to have 1 move</i>
<i>and 1 hit point (unless you are below 1 hit point). Enjoy, or don't, up to</i>
<i>you.</i>

<i>Several adjustments have been made to the legendary races. The changes we</i>
<i>hope will allow a more diverse race and class selection for the player base</i>
<i>who choose to play a legendary race. I understand that this might seem as a</i>
<i>slight nerf to players that have already rolled a legendary race, but we</i>
<i>feel that overall it is a wash.</i>

<i>The changes:</i>
<i>     1. Dargonesti: Stat bonuses should be better for Paladin and Warrior</i>
<i>                    classes.</i>
<i>     2. Phaethon: Alignment adjustments to allow the White Robe class.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 6531"><i>                  Added casting level bonus.</i></div>
<i>     3. Theiwar: Reduced the casting level bonus by 50%. (*rounded up)</i>
<i>                 Added a healing bonus.</i>
<i>     4. Half Ogre: Increased chance to land critical blows and rebalanced</i>
<i>                   stats.</i>

<i>I appreciate the feedback I received from the forums and as always, if you</i>
<i>have any negative comments on this change please diaf.</i>

<i>    A clan <GOD> has been created for the mortals of the immortal staff</i>
<i>34+. This clan will be the home of all immortals who choose to play with</i>
<i>the regular player base. We want to be very transparent about our</i>
<i>interactions with the player base and want to remove the veil of secrecy</i>
<i>that can lead to blame and accusations.</i>

<i>    Immortals that choose to operate amongst the regular players will be</i>
<i>tagged by this clan and have a few rules to follow.</i>

<i>    They are not allowed to carry equipment, spells or skills that are not</i>
<i>obtained by normal means. They are not allowed to equip or store gear that</i>
<i>is considered low limit (typically 2 or less). They are allowed some</i>
<i>comforts and leeway with stat rolling, level progression and rent costs.</i>
<i>Members of <GOD> clan are not to actively engage in pk unless it is in</i>
<i>defense. No preference will be given to members of <GOD> clan surrounding</i>
<i>pk actions. Members of <GOD> clan are not allowed to lead zones, share</i>
<i>their immortal knowledge of the game with others or give in anyway an</i>
<i>unfair advantage to those they choose to play the game with.</i>

<i>    If you see conduct that you feel is out of bounds please report these</i>
<i>infractions to the active Overlord staff. Members of <GOD> clan will have</i>
<i>their mortal character names linked to their immortal and posted on the</i>
<i>forums.</i>

<i>January 12th, 2012</i>

<i>    Next week sometime I am going to be doing a bunch of bug fixing and</i>
<i>skill/spell tweaking.</i>

<i>    Please post any bugs you have found somewhere (tweet me, forums, the</i>
<i>in-game bug command, email, carrier pigeon, bike messenger, stripper-gram</i>
<i>(female strippers only please), greeting card, etc) for me to see. Keep in</i>
<i>mind that just because you know about the bug and think it is a widely</i>
<i>known issue doesn't mean I know anything about it, so post it anyway.</i>

<i>Note: I only work on code issues, so if the sword from that one mob doesn't</i>
<i>      do as much damage or there is a typo in some room description it is a</i>
<i>      creation issue and should be directed elsewhere (Hoss or Sanjuro).</i>

<i>Fyit returns.</i>

<i>    You can purchase ranks again, including the rank to become legendary.</i>
<i>The class specific legendary rank purchases are not active and will remain</i>
<i>off until further notice.</i>

<i>    The costs on rank purchases have been redone and for the most part the</i>
<i>rank-point costs have been lowered, but the coin costs have been increased.</i>
<i>A few things have been combined into one rank to make them more attractive.</i>

<i>December 15th, 2011  -- A New Wipe, A New Hope --</i>

<i>Here we go again, same as it ever was.</i>

<i>    The changes for this wipe are listed below. They aren't as extensive as</i>
<i>in the past, but there is a reason for that. We are planning to spend the</i>
<i>majority of this wipe working on a fairly large scale project (codename:</i>
<i>Lube) that will be introduced later. The changes we made for this wipe were</i>
<i>intended to reduce the power of players some and give the NPCs a chance, it</i>
<i>also won't hurt that PK fights will last longer than 12 seconds.</i>

<i>Zones:</i>
<i>-Dargonesti fully revamped and added back to the game.</i>
<i>-Sahuagin fully revamped and added back to the game.</i>
<i>-Evils to a large extent and neutrals to a lesser should be getting less</i>
<i> experience from doing Deep Mines now.</i>

<i>Ranks and Legendary Ranks:</i>
<i>-For the moment players will not be able to purchase Rank Bonuses from</i>
<i> Fyit. You will be able to gain ranks and store up the points, but the</i>
<i> purchasing will be turned off while I adjust the costs on all of the</i>
<i> bonuses. Fyit should be selling again by Tuesday 12/20.</i>
<i>-Legendary Rank Bonuses (the 5 available per class) will be removed until</i>
<i> further notice. I am going to spend the next month or so redoing them all</i>
<i> to be less overpowered, but still very useful. This might include redoing</i>
<i> some of the skills/spells available to legendary characters, but those</i>
<i> will still be in game.</i>
<i>-Once the Rank Bonuses are back on Fyit you will be able to become</i>
<i> legendary.</i>

<i>Helpfiles:</i>
<i>-All Spell, Skill and Instinct helpfiles are now viewable by everyone at</i>
<i> all times. You previously needed to know the spell, skill or instinct to</i>
<i> read the helpfile on it, no more. Read away.</i>

<i>Spells:</i>
<i>-All spells that do damage have been reviewed and 98% of them have been</i>
<i> changed, mostly for the lower. The intent was to make casters still very</i>
<i> viable at doing damage, but not the powerhouses they were last wipe.</i>
<i>-All spells that do damage will recieve the same percentage bonus at</i>
<i> legendary. The bonus is inherent, so just being legendary will increase</i>
<i> your spell damage. This is in the game now and does not require Legendary</i>
<i> Rank Bonuses to be purchased.</i>
<i>-Most area spells now hit all enemy and neutral targets in the room.</i>
<i> Previously many of these were limited on a spell by spell basis, but that</i>
<i> has been removed because of the next point.</i>
<i>-Area spells took the biggest hit in damage, almost all of them were vastly</i>
<i> reduced. The only one that got a clear buff was malevolent tentacles. The</i>
<i> damage should be enough to make them useful in fights against multiple</i>
<i> targets, but not a clear replacement for a single target spell in a fight</i>
<i> against 1 opponent.</i>

<i>Characters:</i>
<i>-Passwords can now be up to 32 characters long.</i>
<i>-A few other issues around entering passwords were fixed. There might be</i>
<i> more issues, but nothing glaring.</i>
<i>-Using a lore on yourself (scroll or pot) at level 3 or higher will allow</i>
<i> you to see your natural stats in 'score' forever. The stats shown will not</i>
<i> be adjusted by gear, spells, ranks, etc. but will only show your natural</i>
<i> roll.</i>
<i>-The exotic races (theiwar, half-ogre, phaethon and dargonesti) available</i>
<i> once you have a legendary character have had their stats and bonuses</i>
<i> increased to make them more attractive.</i>
<i>-Hit Points gained per level range reduced for all characters. We raised</i>
<i> the minimum hps gained on every class, but left the maximum hps gained</i>
<i> alone. This should result in more hit points for all classes, but not a</i>
<i> massive increase, just a higher average.</i>

<i>Mage Pets:</i>
<i>-There has been a pretty thorough revamp of the mage pets to bring them</i>
<i> more in-line with other pets.</i>

<i>Spell Loads:</i>
<i>-A number of spell loads have been adjusted to make things more balanced.</i>
<i> This especially applies to Shaman charms.</i>

<i>Skills:</i>
<i>-A bunch of skills have been made easier to train to superb. There still</i>
<i> might be problems, but it should be slightly easier.</i>

<i>Items:</i>
<i>-Any item that is part of an item_set will have an indication when it is</i>
<i> lored.</i>
<div class="t 6828"><i>-A very large hatchet was taken to the number of items that could not be</i></div>
<i> lored or identified. Some items can still not be lored, but the number is</i>
<i> far, far less.</i>

<i>Misc:</i>
<i>-Charge, Ravage, Thrash and Bash all use the same calculation to figure out</i>
<i> if the target gets seated now. So dex, bash_mod, juke and other things are</i>
<i> all applied to each of them equally.</i>
<i>-A few instincts had their damage reduced.</i>
<i>-Stasis spell made easier to land for longer durations, but the maximum</i>
<i> duration was reduced (no one was getting close to max duration before).</i>
<i>-Thrust and Drain had their damage reduced, mostly in offensive stance.</i>
<i>-The inherent bonuses for Dark Knight stance have been reduced.</i>
<i>-The bonuses for Dark Knight impair have been reduced a little.</i>
<i>-Ghostdance bonuses reduced.</i>


<i>There were some other minor tweaks here and there, but those were the big</i>
<i>ones.</i>

<i>    A big thanks goes to Hoss, Sanjuro, Arthelas, Starmis and Terk for</i>
<i>helping with all the in-game changes. A lot of the creators also helped</i>
<i>with testing the spell damage changes (particularly Arthelas, he rocked it</i>
<i>out), and I want to give them a personal thank you. Sometimes I feel like I</i>
<i>am working in a vacuum, and it is nice when people take the time to bang on</i>
<i>the things I have done, that way I don't have to test in the "big lab".</i>

<i>    Finally, a thank you to all of the players for coming back time and</i>
<i>again. Without you we wouldn't do this, your deaths keep us warm.</i>

<i>    Have fun. If you notice any problems please tell an immortal, post on</i>
<i>the forums, email me, tell Sancho's mom or write your congressman.</i>

<i>Enjoy yourselves and be safe,</i>

<i>December 6th, 2011 ---- PWIPE opening date/time change</i>

<i>    I am moving the open date/time of the new wipe to December 15th at 3pm</i>
<i>CST (server time).</i>

<i>    This date will not move, we are opening on the 15th. The time might</i>
<i>move by an hour or 2, but we won't know that until the 14th or 15th.</i>

<i>    Plan on this new date.</i>

<i>December 5th, 2011  ---- PWIPE Coming</i>

<i>Time for some housecleaning.</i>

<i>    We will be shutting the game down on December 12th, 2011 around noon</i>
<i>system time (central standard) and deleting all players and rentfiles. See</i>
<i>HELP PWIPE for a very tiny bit more information.</i>

<i>    The expected downtime is 2 days, but this might be extended to 3 days.</i>
<i>So at earliest we will be back December 14th at noon. Watch the web forums</i>
<i>(general discussion) for update posts.</i>

<i>    Normally during this period of time between pwipe being announced and</i>
<i>the actual wipe there are buffs and free gear handed out to players, and</i>
<i>this time around I am sure it will be no different. But! Do not expect</i>
<i>those buffs or gear to be handed out until at least Saturday. We will be</i>
<i>much more free with the player deletions from now until the pwipe, so</i>

<i>November 22nd, 2011</i>

<i>-A few bugs surrounding relocate, teleport, blink and word of recall while</i>
<i> flagged aggressor have been fixed.</i>
<i>-Glowing recall scrolls and the 'word of recall' spell have been changed to</i>
<i> work like a non-glowing recall scroll if you are flagged aggressor.</i>
<i>-Pick should no longer lag the thief if the target of the pick does not</i>
<i> exist.</i>
<i>-HP regeneration while resting will increase every full tick you are</i>

<i>October 27th, 2011 - Twit Happens</i>

<i>    In an attempt to annoy as many people as we can, as often as we can, we</i>
<i>have setup a twitter account that is being fed shouts from the shout log.</i>
<i>Starmis did the underlying work and setup the twitter account:</i>
<i>@ArcticShouts</i>

<i>    We are still working out some of the details, but it is up and active</i>
<i>right now. Starmis has set it up so that # and @ are probably not going to</i>
<i>make it through, so shouting '@ladaygaga likes to #occupy her mouth with my</i>
<i>balls' will not be going through as you planned.</i>

<i>    I have also setup a twitter account for myself where I will post</i>
<i>occasionally about what I am currently working on. I may go quiet for a</i>
<i>time or get 3 or 4 things a day in there. So if you care you can follow</i>
<i>@ArcticAristox.</i>

<i>    If you don't care about twitter, you can continue not caring. Nothing</i>
<i>there is going to change your game experience in anyway.</i>

<i>October 20th, 2011</i>

<i>Bug Fixes:</i>

<i>-Throat Punch had a bunch of messaging issues and typos fixed.</i>
<i>-Hypnotize (instinct command) had a to_room message added.</i>
<i>-Chomp (instinct command) now usable in combat.</i>
<i>-Flesh Shield cast with corpses in the room should never reduce the size of</i>
<i> an existing shield, only increase the size or make no change.</i>
<i>-Help Race Dargonesti updated to reflect the fact they can be any scout</i>
<i> path, not just ocean.</i>
<i>-Charge will have reduced knockdown effectiveness against people with a</i>
<i> good BASH_MOD stat.</i>
<i>-Juke will now help against Charge just like it helps against Bash.</i>
<i>-Gift cooldown on failure reduced.</i>
<i>-Gift will have an increased success chance when the user's moon is</i>
<i> favorable.</i>
<i>-System messages will be echoed to the shout log and available on the web</i>
<i> page like shouts are now.</i>
<i>-A bug with legendary scouts being in a strange quell/instinct state after</i>
<i> logging in has been fixed.</i>
<i>-Danger Sense at legendary stalemating a bash will lag the basher.</i>
<i>-Non-Scouts trying to "bond" with a spirit animal should be given a more</i>
<i> appropriate message.</i>
<i>-Swoop (instinct command) will not be blocked if the target is immune to</i>
<i> swoop.</i>
<i>-All offensive instinct commands should now work in peace rooms against</i>
<i> characters PK flagged to the scout.</i>
<i>-Banish is now considered a mean skill and will fail in peace. It will also</i>
<i> cause aggressive flags.</i>
<i>-Assail finding no target will give messaging and not cause the skill to go</i>
<i> on cooldown.</i>
<i>-Fade should work with hidden doors that are opened now.</i>
<i>-Featherfall will not stack, only one per person.</i>
<i>-Dark Knight dragons that can not move (stunned or held) can no longer</i>
<i> breath.</i>
<i>-Summon Dragon will fail if the dragon is in the same room as the dark</i>
<i> knight casting the spell.</i>
<i>-The Sanction Smith will now repair most bows.</i>

<i>-Lore (barbarian skill) failure cooldown reduced to 1 tick, success</i>
<i> cooldown reduced to 3 ticks, and legendary success cooldown reduced to 1</i>
<i> tick.</i>

<i> be in a strange state with instincts which could only be fixed by logging</i>
<i> out and back in.</i>
<i>-Pick at legendary should work while fighting as was previously advertised.</i>

<i>-Stasis changed to an evocation spell (like it should be and the help file</i>
<i> said it was) from an enchantment spell (which was a mistake).</i>

<i>October 13th, 2011</i>

<i>A somewhat big update to try to even out class balance a bit.</i>

<i>First the miscellaneous changes:</i>

<i> on rooms greater than 5 away.</i>
<i>-Focused spells (not skills) for players with no concentration skill will</i>
<i> not be interrupted by hits that only do bruise damage.</i>
<i>-The underlying logging code for the game has been redone. This was a</i>
<i> rather massive change, but most people won't notice it.</i>

<i>Thief Changes:</i>
<i>-Throat Punch skill, legendary bonuses and helpfile added. Available at</i>
<i> level 5.</i>
<i>(This skill is only taught in solace for the moment, but it should reach</i>
<i> many other guildmasters soon.)</i>

<i>Warrior Changes:</i>
<i>-The Kick skill can now, periodically, increase the rate at which the</i>
<i> kicker swings for a short period of time.</i>

<i>White Robe Changes:</i>
<i>-Enigmatic Dome will now block red robes "peeking" into the room.</i>

<i>Red Robe Changes:</i>
<i>-The force spell bonus "bash" ability had its lag on the target reduced</i>
<i> from 2 rounds to 1 round.</i>
<i>-Force Missiles damage reduced slightly.</i>
<i>-Peek now has a 4 tick reuse timer.</i>

<i> legendary characters.</i>
<i>-Spell Trap legendary chance to keep the spell trapped after it has fired</i>
<i> off was reduced.</i>
<i>-Spell Trap will no longer fire off the trapped spell if it is the same as</i>
<i> the spell being cast. No more double blastwaves or double force missiles.</i>

<i>Shaman Changes:</i>
<i>-Spirit base damage and hitpoints reduced slightly.</i>
<i>-Spirit base hitroll increased.</i>
<i>-Spirits can no longer wield.</i>
<i>-Omen duration and bonus reduced.</i>
<i>-Frenzy healing penalty increased.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 7313"><i>-Frenzy damage and attack chance bonuses reduced.</i></div>
<i>-Frenzy duration at legendary reduced and made variable.</i>
<i>-Darkened Soul duration at legendary reduced.</i>
<i>-Darkened Soul damage calculation changed. It has the same potential, but</i>
<i> should have a lower average damage.</i>
<i>-Vile Spirits damage lowered slightly.</i>
<i>-Vile Spirits at legendary has a chance to cast one of para, silence or</i>
<i> bilndness, not all 3.</i>
<i>-Regenerate healing per tick reduced slightly.</i>
<i>-Regenerate legendary duration bonus reduced.</i>
<i>-Regenerate bonus for certain spirits bound to the shaman's weapon reduced.</i>
<i>-Ritual Voyage will lag the target for 1 round on room entry.</i>

<i>(Only taught in solace for the moment, it should shortly be on many more</i>
<i> guildmasters.)</i>
<i>-The winds spells (western, eastern, northern, southern) are going to be</i>
<i> removed from the druid guild on the next wipe. They will remain on your</i>
<i> character for now, but the tablets they are currently loading on will be</i>
<i> repurposed.</i>
<i>-Prevailing Winds spell added at 8th circle. This spell does exactly what</i>
<i> the northern/eastern/southern/western winds spells did, except it is one</i>
<i> spell and takes an argument to indicate which direction you want to go</i>
<i> (cast 'prevailing winds' east). This is a tablet spell.</i>
<i>-Primal Fury spell added at 7th circle. This is a tablet spell.</i>
<i>-Granite Hand spell added at 7th circle.  This is a tablet spell.</i>
<i>-Iceskin spell added at 5th circle. This is a guild spell.</i>

<i>** The new tablet spells will be loading for the time being on the former</i>
<i>   temporal path and winds spells tablets. This may change at anytime, so</i>
<i>   strike fast!</i>

<i>    Lots of stuff. I might have gone too far on the shaman nerfs. Please</i>
<i>let me know what you think AFTER playing with it for a while.</i>

<i>    I have been cleaning up the master zone file and wanted to let you know</i>
<i>that some zones will become unavailable for play as they are moved back</i>

<i>     A high-level shaman quest has been added to the game with the promise</i>
<i>of tremendous power. For those hexers looking to begin on this deadly</i>
<i>endeavour, seek out the troubled spirit residing beneath an underground</i>

<i>April 29th, 2011</i>

<i>Due to a pair of dead hooker's panties found in one of the floppy drives,</i>
<i>we experienced a brief outage this evening.</i>

<i>* An error occurred when the machine that hosts Arctic was shutdown. Due to</i>
<i>this error, objects in rent were lost. Players may notice that when they</i>
<i>enter the game they may get a rent decay message for items that blew up. To</i>
<i>be clear, only characters that had gear from certain zones were affected,</i>
<i>but all items in rent from those zones were lost. We have weighed the pro's</i>
<i>and con's of doing a playerbase restore and have decided NOT to restore the</i>
<i>playerfiles. We understand that some of you will have lost equipment due to</i>
<i>this, but think of the children.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>April 12th, 2011</i>

<i>    This is a bit delayed, these changes actually went in last week. Sorry,</i>
<i>I didn't have time to post the news at the time of the reboot and it</i>
<i>slipped my mind until today.</i>

<i>Animate Dead:</i>
<i>    The nerf is here. Non-Legendary Clerics will be allowed at most 1</i>
<i>animated corpse, Legendary Clerics can have 2 corpses at one time. Animated</i>
<i>corpses will not hit with offhands, although they can wield them for</i>
<i>bonuses, they just won't ever swing them. The duration on animated corpses</i>
<i>has been increased. After a bit of analysis of the current setup the</i>
<i>duration may be further increased.</i>

<i>Other Changes:</i>
<i>-Legendary Kick had a slight damage increase.</i>
<i>-Legendary Pick should work better on hard-pick doors and objects.</i>
<i>-Legendary Bash bonus shield strike won't work if you are not wearing a</i>
<i> shield.</i>
<i>-Legendary Disarm should work when not wielding now.</i>
<i>-Legendary Parry should start up easier than normal parry now (about 25%</i>
<i> easier). The previous bonus was only applied to continuing parries, not</i>
<i> initial.</i>
<i>-Legendary Nightmare should stun more often than normal now.</i>
<i>-Legendary Sinister Barrage should actually apply the listed bonuses now</i>
<i> (stupid typos).</i>
<i>-Pain spell secondaries that deal damage over time will now award</i>
<i> experience if they perform the killing blow.</i>
<i>-Flesh shield had some checks and balances rearranged to make it work</i>
<i> properly at legendary and normal. There might be a bug or two hidden in</i>
<i> here still, keep an eye open.</i>
<i>-Legendary Iceshield melee deflection will actually reduce the damage now,</i>
<i> not just give the messaging.</i>

<i>April 4th, 2011</i>

<i>Everything is working fine, nothing to see here.</i>

<i>    I posted way too much information about the changes that went in during</i>
<i>today's shutdown on the forum, as a reply to the NEWS post from April 1st.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>April 1st, 2011</i>

<i>[THIS IS NOT AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE]</i>

<i>    There will be a shutdown and downtime of the game sometime on Monday,</i>
<i>April 4th. I expect the game to be down between 1 and 2 hours. My guess is</i>
<i>this downtime will start between 10am and 12pm system time (CST), but that</i>
<i>might flucuate.</i>

<i>    I need to perform an upgrade of the code that will change the way most</i>
<i>of the backend data we store is handled (mobs, rooms, objects). These</i>
<i>changes were made to facilitate a few creation projects that are going on,</i>
<i>as well as to make our lives a bit easier overall.</i>

<i>    If anything changes I will try to update the news.</i>

<i>I just wanted to give you a heads-up,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>

<i>   Months ago, a party of the greatest hunters of Abanasinia set out to</i>

<i>A Changing of the Guard</i>
<i>======================</i>

<i>Dear Adventurers of Arctic,</i>

<i>   I am retiring. When I first joined the staff in 2002, I never dreamed</i>
<i>that I would have your trust in guiding our blip of the internet. I hope I</i>
<i>was worthy.</i>

<i>   Life has begun to get the better of me. For over a year now it</i>
<i>has been difficult for me to find time to support the game at the level I</i>
<i>would like. In the near future this time will disintegrate fully. Arctic,</i>
<i>though, is in good hands. Many people have stepped into new roles and</i>
<i>haven taken over the lion's share of my duties.</i>

<i>   Moving forward, Rhak will become the head of creation. I will be</i>
<i>around, weighing in on major game directions, but generally not involved</i>
<i>with day to day management issues. I hope to continue to see the many</i>
<i>friends I have made through the years as I check in from time to time.</i>

<i>   I appreciate all the support and criticism I have received through the</i>
<i>years as it has definitely helped me grow and learn as a leader.</i>

<i>                    Happy Hunting,</i>
<i>                    Terk E. Byrd</i>


<i>   P.S. *Gobble* *Gobble*</i>

<i>Casting Level Changes are Active:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP CASTING LEVEL. This is an experiment with the goal of</i>
<i>giving mages a reason to need equipment and not be completely naked. None</i>
<i>of this is set in stone, it can and probably will be changed. The start</i>
<i>level (15) might be upped, the int bonuses might be increased or removed,</i>
<i>the gear bonuses might change or something else might happen. Please keep</i>
<i>an open mind, I am not out to get you, this is done to help the game not</i>
<i>ruin your experience. If you have suggestions or complaints, please post</i>
<i>them on the forums or email me directly.</i>

<i>Scouts:</i>
<i>-Legendary instinct code is done and in game along with the helpfiles.</i>
<i>-The legendary instincts are not available yet, there is some creation work</i>
<i> to do around adding the animals and the spirits with which to bond. This</i>
<i> should hopefully be done this week, but its not my job so I can't give a</i>
<i> better timeline.</i>
<i>-A bug with scout through doors from the legendary rank has been fixed.</i>

<i>Red Robes:</i>
<i>-Astral Beacon had its duration shortened quite a bit.</i>
<i>-The 'Student of Magic' legendary rank had all of the bonuses to Astral</i>
<i> Beacon removed.</i>
<i>-The 'Student of Magic' legendary rank had bonuses to Peek added as</i>
<i> compensation. Only 3 people owned that rank and if they are truly and</i>
<i> madly upset about it they can talk to me.</i>
<i>-Astral Beacon will now player-kill flag the caster against the target on</i>
<i> cast.</i>

<i>Black Robes:</i>
<i>-Initiating an attack against a flesh-shielded black robe should begin a</i>
<i> fight now.</i>
<i>-Stasis is slightly harder to land initiall.</i>
<i>-Stasis has a chance to break each round.</i>

<i>Barbarians:</i>
<i>-Revivification cooldown was significantly reduced.</i>

<i>Clerics:</i>
<i>-Cleanse should no longer dispel your Gates.</i>

<i>White Robes:</i>
<i>-Shards of Arcana with the legendary rank bonus damage reduced a little.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 28th, 2011</i>

<i>Please note: Not all items that have had casting level mod added to them</i>
<i>actually currently have casting level mod. If the change was made after</i>
<i>one of these items was popped, then the amount of casting_level_mod will</i>
<i>be different from what it actually should be.</i>

<i>Example:</i>

<i>Aristox Popped the Robe of Darkness 1 month ago. Terk added</i>
<i>casting_level_mod to it 2 weeks ago. Aristox's version of the Robe will</i>
<i>not increase his casting level. A freshly popped version of the item will</i>
<i>have casting level bonuses.</i>

<i>Januray, 25th, 2011</i>

<i>There are quite a few things here, I suggest you read the whole post.</i>

<i>Legendary Scouts are now available for the most part:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY SCOUT for more information.</i>

<i>-The Legendary Instincts are not done yet, these are still coming. I will</i>
<i> post something else in the news when they are ready. It might be this</i>
<i> week, but probably next week.</i>

<i>Other Scout Changes:</i>
<i>    The way instinct and quell work has been adjusted. Previously there was</i>
<i>a complex set of cooldowns fired off whenever you added a new instinct or</i>
<i>quelled an instinct, this has all been removed.</i>

<i>    The new system is lag-based. There is a single round of lag for</i>
<i>succesfully connecting to an animal through use of the instinct command.</i>
<i>There are two rounds of lag when the instinct command is unsuccessful. Quell</i>
<i>has no lag at all associated with it, you can drop instincts whenever you</i>
<i>want.</i>

<i>    This system is meant to give scouts a more dynamic play experience when</i>
<i>it comes to instincts, dropping and swapping them during combat more often</i>
<i>and putting up the useful non-combat ones when they are between fights.</i>

<i>    All of the instincts that had re-use cooldowns still have those</i>
<i>cooldowns, although a couple of them have been shortened.</i>

<i>    Please let us know how this system is working for you.</i>


<i>Paladin Changes:</i>
<i>-Beseech had its cooldown lowered.</i>
<i>-Divine Focus had its cooldown lowered.</i>
<i>-Righteous Will had its cooldown lowered a lot.</i>
<i>-Righteous Will had its duration lowered quite a bit.</i>
<i>-The HELP LEGENDARY PALADIN file was changed to make a few things more</i>
<i> clear.</i>
<i>-A few bugs with legendary paladin ranks were fixed.</i>


<i>Robed Mage Changes Coming Next Week:</i>
<i>    This is NOT in the game yet, but it will be next week. We are changing</i>
<i>the way robed mages work in relation to equipment by adding a new stat:</i>
<div class="t 8688"><i>casting level</i></div>
<i>    Some of you may have already noticed this stat on equipment you are</i>
<i>wearing, it is currently doing nothing. Next week this stat will become</i>
<i>functional, there will be another news post about it when that happens.</i>

<i>    For now you should read HELP CASTING LEVEL and try to get equipment</i>
<i>ready for when the change happens. Also, feel free to ask questions</i>
<i>(in-game or on the forums) about the stat. Some of the gear is still being</i>
<i>changed (mostly the very top end of mage gear), so keep an eye out for</i>
<i>changes. Lore early, Lore often.</i>

<i>Other Robed Mage Stuff:</i>
<i>-Three bugs with Gravity Well have been fixed.</i>
<i>-A bug with Fluke has been fixed.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 21st, 2011</i>

<i>    The Paladin Legendary Requirement Quest has been changed, sort of.</i>
<i>Previously the quest (Slay the leader of the Dark Knights) was set to work</i>
<i>when killing Lord Ariakan while he was visiting the Temple of Takhisis,</i>
<i>this was odd and wrong.</i>

<i>    The quest has been fixed/changed to require killing Lord Ariakan while</i>
<i>he is in Storm's Keep. So please look for him there. Sorry for the</i>
<i>confusion, but the guy gets around.</i>

<i>    Anyone who had not already completed the quest will have to kill him</i>
<i>in Storm's Keep now.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 20th, 2011</i>

<i>Legendary Black Robes are now available:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY BLACK ROBE for more information.</i>

<i>Last One: Scouts (don't expect Scouts to be done for at least a week)</i>

<i>Other Stuff:</i>
<i>-The upgrades to quite a number of Black Robe spells when they are cast</i>
<i> with components have been reduced. This is similar to what was done to the</i>
<i> other two robes recently.</i>
<i>-Stasis and Mind Mangle are now easier to land.</i>
<i>-Nightmare had its damage increased slightly.</i>
<i>-Pain now works against undead targets.</i>
<i>-Rend now works against undead targets, but provides no flesh shield</i>
<i> replenishment against them.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 8844"><i>-The bug with relocate not working on guildmasters for people under level</i></div>
<i> 28 should be fixed.</i>
<i>-The bug with fade while resting or sitting not working for people with the</i>
<i> proper legendary rank has been fixed.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 18th, 2011</i>

<i>- Thief legendary rank 3 should now work as intended</i>
<i>- Bugs in devouring spirits and ghost berries have been fixed</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>January 17th, 2011</i>

<i>Added filters to exclude certain keywords when specifying mobs and objects.</i>
<i>Basically you can now use commands like "buy !glowing.recall", "kill    </i>
<i>dwarf.!king", "get all.!leg chest" etc. For more details, see HELP SEARCHING.</i>
<i>If you notice anything strange, let me know.</i>
<i>Thanks to Nasredin for the suggestion.</i>

<i>Other changes:</i>

<i>- The dispel command now works on blur, shield, strength, detect invis and</i>
<i>detect magic.</i>
<i>- Tether should now flag properly.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>January 13th, 2011</i>

<i>Legendary Red Robes are now available:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY RED ROBE for more information.</i>

<i>Next: Black Robes</i>

<i>Other Changes:</i>
<i>-The spells 'boost', 'potency' and 'dark accord' have been made mutually</i>
<i> exclusive. You can only have one of them up at a time.</i>
<i>-The cooldown on drain was increased.</i>
<i>-Shards of Arcana got reworked. The damage has been increased (not back to</i>
<i> where it was 2 weeks ago) and it has some added affects on the target now.</i>
<i>-Chain Lightning had its base damage increased.</i>
<i>-Potency had its base affect slightly reduced.</i>
<i>-Force Missile will have 1 less missile at level 30.</i>
<i>-Blastwave will make the targets fumble less often.</i>
<i>-Shocking Blast had its base damage reduced.</i>
<i>-Thunderbolt had its base damage reduced.</i>
<i>-Read Magic was given failure conditions. You are not going to be able to</i>
<i> read a book 100% of the time.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 11th, 2011</i>

<i>Legendary White Robes are now available:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY WHITE ROBE for more information.</i>

<i>Next up: Red Robes.</i>

<i>Other Important Stuff:</i>
<i>-All Magic User spells (circles 1 to 4) got reviewed and a lot of them got</i>
<i> nerfed.</i>
<i>-All White Robe spells got reviewed and a lot of them got nerfed. A couple</i>
<i> of these nerfs might have gone a little too far, I will be watching over</i>
<i> the next couple of days to see if something needs more work.</i>
<i>-DK dragons now have a timer. They will disappear after a certain amount of</i>
<i> time. Other similar pets (mage and paladin pets) have timers, for some</i>
<i> reason DK pets didn't get one.</i>
<i>-Teleport will no longer work on people you aren't grouped or clanned with</i>
<i> unless you are casting at level 24 or higher.</i>
<i>-Relocate will no longer work on people you aren't grouped or clanned with</i>
<i> unless you are casting at level 28 or higher.</i>
<i>-Mass Teleport will no longer work on people you aren't grouped or clanned</i>
<i> with unless you are casting at level 28 or higher.</i>
<i>-The level limits on teleport/mass teleport/relocate do not apply to</i>
<i> magical anchors or relocatable NPCs (like guildmasters).</i>
<i>-Transference got a pretty big nerf.</i>
<i>-Residual Attack got a decent sized nerf.</i>

<i>    When I am reviewing the Red Robe spells for their legendary work I will</i>
<i>be nerfing them in a similar way to what I just did to White Robes. Black</i>
<i>Robes will get the same treatment after Red Robes are done. I don't expect</i>
<i>to be nerfing Red and Black Robes as much as I did White Robes.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 7th, 2011</i>

<i>Legendary Shamans are now available:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY SHAMAN for more information.</i>
<i>-The channel skill got reworked some, it should be more useful now.</i>

<i>Other Changes:</i>
<i>-Heal Boost no longer stacks, only 1 up per character. The bonus given by a</i>
<i> single Heal Boost has been increased to compensate. This should help</i>
<i> soloing shamans, slightly hurt groups with multiple shamans.</i>
<i>-Rank progress should now show in the prompt for people that are at max</i>
<i> experience, but haven't reached rank 1 yet.</i>
<i>-The cooldown on mend success and failure has been lowered some.</i>
<i>-Paladin mounts, Dark Knight dragons and Shaman spirits should now manifest</i>
<i> at full health in all cases. Mage pets will get a similar treatment during</i>
<i> their legendary reviews.</i>
<i>-Earthquake should respect NOBASH now.</i>
<i>-Mass Fly adjusted by the legendary druid rank should work properly now.</i>
<i>-Steal on equipped items for legendary thieves with the proper rank should</i>
<i> actually work now. Note: This is at a really low % chance and doesn't work</i>
<i> on players in combat.</i>
<i>-The legendary warrior rank that improves sitting bash chance has been</i>
<i> improved.</i>
<i>-The fear aspect of the turn skill should no longer work against</i>
<i> IMMUNE_FEAR targets.</i>

<i>Next up for legendary review: White Robes</i>
<i>    While doing the legendary reviews for each robe class I will also be</i>
<i>doing a sweep through all of their spells and skills to adjust things for</i>
<i>balancing reasons. Expect nerfs in most cases. I will try to be gentle.</i>

<i>Legendary Thieves are now available:</i>
<i>    Please read HELP LEGENDARY THIEF for more information.</i>

<i>Next up: Shamans</i>

<i>Other Stuff:</i>
<i>-Dark Knight's inherent bonus while in defensive stance has been nerfed</i>
<i> slightly. This was done to bring them more in line with other tanking</i>
<i> classes.</i>
<i>-Pets should gain rank experience in more situations. Any thing that would</i>
<i> give a player rank experience should now give rank experience to pets. The</i>
<i> master is not required to be at 1xp for the pet to gain rank experience.</i>
<i>-The legendary ranks for Druids that improved fly and insect swarm have</i>
<i> been fixed, they were buggy before.</i>
<i>-The spell 'negative plane protection' should work properly again, it has</i>
<i> been bugged for a few weeks.</i>
<i>-Dark Knights should not lose status while affected by impunity now.</i>
<i> Adepali and I both fixed this bug, so it should be doubly fixed.</i>
<i>-The 'pardon' command is no longer usable while charmed.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>January 1st, 2011</i>

<i>Some temporary fixes which will most likely be reworked when time permits:</i>

<i>- If you have more than two magical shield spells up (fireshield, iceshield </i>
<i>  etc) only two randomly chosen shields will take effect when someone hits </i>
<i>  you.</i>
<i>- All spell damage has had a cap applied to it, which won't be noticeable </i>
<i>  by most.</i>
<i>- A bug with teleport targetting has been fixed.</i>

<i>-Impair training should be more logical.</i>

<i>Barbarian Skill Changes:</i>

<i> (although not all weapons). The bonuses are also better, but not as easy</i>
<i> to discern. Play with it some to figure it out.</i>
<i>-Carve skill rewritten. The food created from carve is now no-rent (this</i>
<i> happened yesterday). The food will now also provide a buff to the eater if</i>
<i> the barb passes a skill check when creating it. The buff granted depends</i>
<div class="t 9110"><i> on the skill of barbarian and the race of the corpse being carved.</i></div>
<i>-Mend skill upgraded. This skill should now repair a lot more items and for</i>
<i> a lot more. At max skill its equivalent to the Sanction Blacksmith.</i>
<i>-Lore skill upgraded. The skill will now work a lot like the identify spell</i>
<i> that Red Robes have, but the level of the lore is determined by your</i>
<i> skill, not your level.</i>

<i>Legendary Barbarians Available:</i>
<i>    I am currently doing a rewrite on all of the Legendary skills and ranks</i>
<i>available to each class. These will be released one at a time, Barbarians</i>
<i>are the first one finished.</i>

<i>You can see the bonuses available to Barbarians by reading:</i>
<i>HELP LEGENDARY BARBARIAN</i>

<i>    Clerics are the next class up for the legendary rewrite.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>

<i>    Some of you may have noticed that the quest for 'regenerate' is</i>
<i>slightly different now, and some of your old tricks no longer work. With a</i>
<i>keen eye and some perseverance, however, you should be able to uncover how</i>
<i>to solve it.</i>

<i>December 2nd, 2010</i>

<i>Welcome to player wipe number 16.</i>

<i>    Someone else can go into a description of the wipe 15's events, I am</i>
<i>going to give a run down of the changes.</i>

<i>    Robed Mages are now live and in game.</i>
<i>-Please read http://mud.arctic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=841 for more</i>
<i> detail on them.</i>

<i>    Shamans have received a large reworking to separate them from Druids as</i>
<i>much as possible.</i>
<i>-Please read http://mud.arctic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=898 for more</i>
<i> details.</i>

<i>    Most of the other guilds have had tweaks and additions. There are other</i>
<i>news posts detailing some of these changes, but a few of them have not been</i>
<i>listed anywhere.</i>

<i>    Racial stat modifiers have been updated.</i>
<i>-Please read http://mud.arctic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=894 for more</i>
<i> information.</i>

<i>    Racial aging has been changed for all playable races.</i>
<i>-All races will now be at their peak around age 45.</i>
<i>-After 45 all races will start to degrade, around 65 they will degrade</i>
<i> faster.</i>
<i>-The addition of the spell 'youth' on the Black Robe class should help</i>
<i> combat this to some extent.</i>
<i>-These changes are to all stats (attributes, hits, health, moves).</i>
<i>-The Exotic races (also known as legendary or epic races) will degrade much</i>
<i> slower than normal races. A small perk for leveling a second character.</i>

<i>    Magical Saves have been changed.</i>
<i>-Previously saves were determined by your level and your guild, with</i>
<i> adjustments for equipment and in some cases race.</i>
<i>-Now saves are determined by your level, all guilds have the same saves,</i>
<i> and your race. Equipment still modifies saves in the same way.</i>
<i>-Each race modifies saves in a different way.</i>
<i>-This is a quite deliberate nerf to save chance. Spells will land more</i>
<i> often at high levels.</i>
<i>-These numbers are really hard to test in a vacuum and will be in flux. You</i>
<i> really shouldn't notice a difference until level 30, but please keep an</i>
<i> eye out for anything you think is out of whack and let someone know about</i>
<i> it.</i>

<i>    Bash has been changed (yes again) back sort of to what it was before.</i>
<i>-The experiment at the end of last wipe was not a failure, it was just</i>
<i> underwhelming. That system has been removed.</i>
<i>-The checks that were in place at the end of last wipe are still there, and</i>
<i> done the same way. With one exception: Bashing a sitting opponent is now a</i>
<i> decent sized penalty to your bash chance.</i>
<i>-This means that dex still plays an important role for both the basher and</i>
<i> the bashee.</i>
<i>-The woozy-standing affect stuff has been removed completely.</i>
<i>-Basher and Bashee both now lag for 2 rounds on a successful bash.</i>

<i>    Reciting while sitting or resting has returned.</i>
<i>-With the changes to bash above, it only makes sense to put sit-recalling</i>
<i> back in.</i>

<i>    Allowed Races for some Guilds have been expanded:</i>
<i>-Shamans now have Gnomes and Half Elves as allowed races.</i>
<i>-Barbarians now have Half Elves as an allowed race.</i>
<i>-Magic Users now have Half Ogres(legendaries only) as an allowed race.</i>
<i>-Scouts now have Hylar Dwarves as an allowed race.</i>
<i>-Paladins now have Kagonesti Elves, Half Elves and Dargonesti</i>
<i> Elves(legendaries only) as allowed races.</i>
<i>-Dark Knights now have Silvanesti Elves, Kagonesti Elves, Goblins and Half</i>
<i> Ogres(legendaries only) as allowed races.</i>

<i>    More Barbarian changes were made.</i>
<i>-Charge cooldown was lowered from 3 combat rounds to 2.</i>
<i>-Into the Breach will no longer cancel itself once started.</i>
<i>-A new command 'settle down' was added that cancels into the breach if it</i>
<i> is active. It says 'Huh?' in all other situations.</i>

<i>    Clerics had two new (really old) spells added.</i>
<i>-Holy Word is now available in high level books.</i>
<i>-Wave of Terror is now available in high level books.</i>

<i>Red Robes had a few upgrades.</i>
<i>    -Boost spell removed.</i>
<i>-Potency spell added.</i>
<i>-Force Missiles should bypass the shield spell more often now.</i>
<i>-Thunderbolt damage upgraded.</i>
<i>-Blastwave given an upgrade.</i>

<i>    White Robes had a little bit of a nerf.</i>
<i>-Potency spell removed.</i>
<i>-Boost spell added.</i>
<i>-Shards of Arcana damage reduced a little.</i>

<i>    Spell Books and Spell Loads:</i>
<i>-All spell loads were reviewed.</i>
<i>-All old mage class books were removed, only robe spells should load now.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 9313"><i>-Shaman charm and Cleric prayerbook load rates increased some.</i></div>
<i>-Robe spellbook and Druid tablet load rates lowered some to compensate for</i>
<i> the removal of the sheaf system.</i>

<i>    A massive review of shields was done.</i>
<i>-This was done to create good shield_block shields and good bashing</i>
<i> shields, but not many that are good at both.</i>
<i>-All of the NPCs that were immune to shield_block have been reviewed and</i>
<i> about 80% of them are now shield blockable.</i>

<i>    Skills made easier to superb, kind of.</i>
<i>-A lot of skills that were really difficult to get to superb were made</i>
<i> easier. Not a lot easier, just a little.</i>

<i>    NPCs that were immune sleep reviewed.</i>
<i>-A lot of NPCs that were immune_sleep are now sleepable. More changes to</i>
<i> come.</i>

<i>    The experience amount to get to max exp was lowered.</i>
<i>-All of the lowered experience came in the levels 28, 29 and 30.</i>

<i>    Rank experience required for each rank lowered.</i>
<i>-It should be easier to get to rank 20, past that its about the same.</i>

<i>    Rank experience granting NPCs reviewed.</i>
<i>-There should be more rank gained in general.</i>

<i>    Decay timers on rent decay equipment reviewed.</i>
<i>-A few were made shorter.</i>
<i>-Most were made a lot longer.</i>

<i>    Quests updated.</i>
<i>-A bunch of quests for spells were cleaned up or made easier.</i>
<i>-Some were updated to reflect the new spells available.</i>
<i>-Rose quest added for legendary Knights of the Sword. Speak to Lord Derek</i>
<i> Crownguard.</i>

<i>    Legendary Ranks removed for now.</i>
<i>-There is a full revamp of the legendary ranks and skills underway. I am</i>
<i> hoping it is done in the next 2 or 3 weeks.</i>
<i>-For now you will not be allowed to become legendary, sorry.</i>

<i>    Objects in the game were given a review.</i>
<i>-A lot of guild restriction flags and other things were updated. This was</i>
<i> mostly cleanup work for the robed mages.</i>
<i>-Quite a few other little tweaks to objects.</i>

<i>    This is by no means a complete list of changes, but you get the gist of</i>
<i>what we have been up to these last few days.</i>

<i>    Thanks go out to Terk, Wratha, Flook, Rorc, Rafo and Arthelas for</i>
<i>pulling a lot of this wipe stuff together. We all hope you enjoy the</i>
<i>changes.</i>

<i>Good Luck,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 24th, 2010  **** Player Wipe Date Announced ****</i>

<i>    We will be wiping the playerbase on Monday, November 29th, 2010</i>
<i>sometime between 3:00pm and 4:00pm local server time (Central Timezone US).</i>

<i>For those of you not familiar with playerwipes:</i>
<i>    We shut the game down and delete all of the players and all of the</i>
<i>clans. We then have a period of time when the players are not allowed to</i>
<i>log in while we do clean up work and implement some changes.</i>

<i>    The downtime for this player wipe will end sometime on Thursday,</i>
<i>December 2nd, 2010, probably again between 3 and 4pm server time.</i>

<i>    You will not be able to play for those 3 days, please do not attempt to</i>
<i>login. You can watch the NEWS section of the forums</i>
<i>(http://mud.arctic.org/forum/) for updates, but don't expect too many.</i>

<i>    In the past during this chaotic time between the announcement of the</i>
<i>pwipe and the actual pwipe we have handed out buffs and free gear. This</i>
<i>will happen again this time, but please do not expect it to start happening</i>
<i>until Sunday at the earliest.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 23rd, 2010</i>

<i>- Pet trainers have arrived in Wayreth for all your familiar, golem and</i>
<i>  monster training needs.</i>

<i>-- Wratha</i>


<i>November 22nd, 2010</i>

<i>-The Robed Mage legendary requirement mobs have been changed. Each has robe</i>
<i> has a different requirement now.</i>
<i>-Punch damage lowered some.</i>
<i>-Conjure skill pets tweaked and naming tweaked. Should be easier to name</i>
<i> all your pets now.</i>
<i>-Impair skill made slightly easier to train.</i>

<i>Shaman stuff:</i>
<i>-Wood Shape moved from 2nd circle to 1st circle.</i>
<i>-Wood Shape weapons upgraded slightly.</i>
<i>-Ancestral blessing moved from 1st to 2nd circle.</i>
<i>-Clot healing improved. It is now a lot closer to cure light levels of</i>
<i> healing, although still weaker than cure light.</i>
<i>-Hex at low levels should actually do something when it lands now.</i>
<i>-New spell added: 'spiritual guidance' at level 1.</i>

<i>    The intent with the Shaman changes is to make leveling from 1 until</i>
<i>about level 10 a bit more interesting. Standing around whiffing for round</i>
<i>after round is not that much fun.</i>

<i>    These are just my first pass at some Shaman changes. There will be a</i>
<i>bunch of changes coming to them over the next few weeks. I want to remove</i>
<i>the nature theme from them completely and move them solidly into the spirit</i>
<i>and undead theme they are focused on later in the levels. This will mean a</i>
<i>lot of spells will be renamed, changed or removed. The goal is to not</i>
<i>really end up with a nerf of shamans, but to keep them close to where they</i>
<i>are now, with hopefully a slight buff. I will be reviewing all their skills</i>
<i>and spells along the way, but a good number of them will not get any</i>
<i>changes. We also are planning on changing the quests for some of the higher</i>
<i>end spells to be more doable by everyone, not just the most elite players.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 21st, 2010</i>

<i>- New skill for robed mages: 'conjure' is available at the Wayreth</i>
<i>  guildmasters for those level 25 or higher.  See HELP SKILL CONJURE </i>
<i>  for more information.</i>

<i>  A pet trainer will be added to the game in the next day or so.</i>
<i>  Thanks to Arthelas for getting the vast bulk of this together.</i>

<i>-- Wratha</i>


<i>November 19th, 2010</i>

<i>Legendary Character Bonuses:</i>
<i>-All classes have had their inate bonuses for being legendary changed. The</i>
<i> bonuses were really inconsistent and poorly laid out before. An effort has</i>
<i> been made to even them out across all guilds. This just refers to the</i>
<i> bonuses for being legendary, not the skills or ranks available (like DKs</i>
<i> being IMPUNITY and druids being CAN_FLY).</i>
<i>-Sometime in the next month a re-write of all the legendary ranks and</i>
<i> skills will be done, at that time helpfiles will be created for each guild</i>
<i> detailing their legendary bonuses pretty thoroughly. For now you can try</i>
<i> to figure out what you got.</i>

<i>Robed Mages:</i>
<i>-All 3 robe guilds have had the Arctic Legend rank made available. The</i>
<i> quest is the same as the one the mage class had to complete previous, but</i>
<i> the required spells are different for each robe.</i>
<i>-The legendary ranks available to the robes are currently the same as the</i>
<i> ones the old mage class had available, this will change during the</i>
<i> legendary review next month.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 18th, 2010</i>

<i>Minor Stuff:</i>
<i>-The 'resist' spell had an 'acid' option added to it.</i>
<i>-Righteous Will got a bit of nerfing.</i>

<i>Paladin Stuff:</i>
<div class="t 9360"><i>    Shield Block got a really hefty re-write. The skill should go off a</i></div>
<i>whole lot more, but it will block 100% of the damage less. Instead it</i>
<i>should be doing pretty constant deflections for partial damage. In essence</i>
<i>it will work like a floating value limit damage. The amount deflected is</i>
<i>now based on your strength, dexterity and a little bit on your</i>
<i>intelligence. High faith will also provide a bonus to the amount deflected.</i>
<i>The shield used now really matters. Heavy shields are bad. Any shield over</i>
<i>weight 30 is going to penalize your ability to shield block. Any shield</i>
<i>under weight 20 will provide a small boost to your ability to block. The</i>
<i>quality of the shield matters as well, the higher quality the more damage</i>
<i>you will deflect. All of these changes will be accompanied with a review of</i>
<i>all the blocking shields in the game, but don't expect that to be finished</i>
<i>for a few weeks.</i>
<i>    The shield weight part of the equation was added to make shields that</i>
<i>are attractive for bashing less attractive for shield blocking. The reason</i>
<i>for this should be more clear when you read the next section.</i>

<i>Warrior Stuff:</i>
<i>    Warriors will now get Shield Block as a skill at level 20. They will</i>
<i>have a lower skill cap than Paladins and the faith bonuses that Paladins</i>
<i>get will not apply to Warriors. This all adds up to Warriors never being as</i>
<i>good at shield blocking as Paladins. Warriors also have Parry, so it should</i>
<i>come out in the wash. The attempt here is to bring both Paladins and</i>
<i>Warriors closer to the end game tanking ability of Barbarians.</i>
<i>    The Punch skill has been given an overhaul. The damage has been</i>
<i>significantly increased. The affects of punching someone are now slightly</i>
<i>random, but vastly upgraded. When someone with a high skill punches you,</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 9547"><i>you will more than likely know it. The lag on Punch has also been removed,</i></div>
<i>but the skill has been given a cooldown between uses (2 rounds on a</i>
<i>failure, 3 on a success).</i>
<i>    The Danger Sense skill (spidey sense?!?) has been upgraded. It should</i>
<i>be doing more now and give a message when it does something. It won't</i>
<i>always be obvious what it did and what it does won't always work, but you</i>
<i>should know its trying. Also, Warriors with Danger Sense and Shield block</i>
<i>now have a special chance to stop backstabs.</i>


<i>Other Stuff:</i>
<i>    I know it looks like I skipped Thieves and Shamans in my class reviews,</i>
<i>but that is only half right. I did skip Shamans, I need to do more research</i>
<i>before I decide if anything needs to be done (nerf or buff). If you have</i>
<i>opinions please post them on the forums. I am skipping Thieves, I think</i>
<i>they are fine where they are. Clerics got skipped for the same reason.</i>
<i>Druids got skipped because they are so broken that they need a full revamp,</i>
<i>so I am not wasting time on them now.</i>

<i>I am done babbling,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 17th, 2010</i>

<i>-A new Paladin skill has been added for Knights of the Sword: righteous will</i>
<i>-The Paladin spell Exorcism has had its damaged lowered slightly.</i>
<i>-The White Robe spell Splintered Mind is no longer self-dispellable.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 16th, 2010 - Robed Mage Beta</i>

<i>    We are going to start the beta for all three robed mages today. We hope</i>
<i>you all enjoy the changes, they should make things interesting to say the</i>
<i>least and a little bit closer to Dragonlance lore.</i>

<i>    This also means that you can no longer start a character of the mage</i>
<i>class.</i>

<i>    To be part of the test you will need to make a new character of the</i>
<i>class Magic User. You then will level up to level 10. You will have to</i>
<i>discover along the way the spells 'magic bolt' and 'magic blast' which are</i>
<i>not taught in the normal guilds. There are multiple places that load both</i>
<i>spells, but you will have to leave the towns to find them.</i>

<i>    Once you have those 2 spells and are level 10, you can travel to the</i>
<i>Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth and take The Test. Please read HELP GUILD</i>
<i>MAGIC USER and HELP CONCLAVE TEST before you take the test.</i>

<i>    If you successfully complete the test you will then be able to decide</i>
<i>which robe you want to become. Your alignment will not matter before you</i>
<i>pick your robe, you will be changed to the appropriate alignment for that</i>
<i>robe. Theiwars are not allowed to change into White Robes, sorry.</i>

<i>    After changing your class into the robe you want, you should talk to</i>
<i>the guildmaster for that robe in Wayreth.</i>

<i>White Robe: Wilma</i>
<i>Red Robe: Ferris</i>
<i>Black Robe: Lotus</i>

<i>    All three are teleportable like other mage guildmasters. After that,</i>
<i>please have fun leveling. Most of the spells are not available in the</i>
<i>guild, you will have to find them in books. If you see anything you think</i>
<i>is a bug please report it on the forums in the Game Bugs forum or you can</i>
<i>use the bug command if you want.</i>

<i>This project has been massive and long, like my co....</i>

<i>    We have started and stopped the conclave project at least 7 times since</i>
<i>I began my involvement in the game at the immortal level. At least 3 of</i>
<i>those started and stopped personally by me.</i>

<i>I would like to thank:</i>
<i>-Arthelas for helping with some of the design, writing a bunch of the</i>
<i> messaging and fixing up my terrible helpfiles.</i>
<i>-Wratha for contributing some of the code and design. </i>
<i>-Terk for keeping the design work honest. </i>
<i>-Rhak for helping with some the design and doing a large chunk of the</i>
<i> pre-alpha bug testing and balance testing.</i>
<i>-Adepali for unknowingly adding a little bit of code I used.</i>
<i>-Kam and Koi for commenting on everything along the way.  </i>
<i>-Flair (black robe), Chase (white robe) and Torq (red robe) for leading the</i>
<i> alpha tests and generally making my life easier.</i>
<i>-All of the immortals that tested the classes. </i>
<i>and finally:</i>
<i>-Tregar and Scrappinak for absolutely nothing. Jerks!</i>

<i>Terk would like to add:</i>

<i>    The Conclave Test has been a huge creation project that has taken a</i>
<i>team of 9 creators over two and a half years to complete. It is a new style</i>
<i>of zone that takes experiences that players generally report enjoying such</i>
<i>as the quests for 'heal' and 'regenerate' to the next level of unique</i>
<i>personal accomplishment.</i>
<i>   The Conclave Test could not have been made without the substantial</i>
<i>efforts of the test creators Arthelas, Horton, Rafo, Helati, Dyl, Wukong,</i>
<i>Bugg, and Willoe. Each creator developed at least one of the many tests</i>
<i>that magic users interested in becoming a wizard of high sorcery will</i>
<i>face. Deserving more praise for implementing zone wide additions is</i>
<i>Sanjuro, who has tweaked and tinkered with nearly every aspect of the zone</i>
<i>in addition to his individually created tests.</i>
<i>    All of these creators should be lauded for their dedication to the</i>
<i>game. Please refer to the new helpfiles "AREA WAYRETH" and "CONCLAVE TEST"</i>
<i>for more information.</i>

<i>Back to me:</i>

<i>    I would also like to thank the players for their patience through the</i>
<i>many reboots I scheduled throughout this process. I hope you have fun with</i>
<i>the classes. I would love to hear feedback, good or bad, from everyone</i>
<i>(except Rafo).</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 15th, 2010 part 3</i>

<i>-A bug with dark knight drain not landing has been fixed.</i>
<i>-After lots of reports that it was a bug, I removed the feature of drain</i>
<i> that a miss would cause the target to automatically use an aggressive</i>
<i> skill on you if the target is an NPC.</i>
<div class="t 9594"><i>-The chance to land gaze for dark knight's has been raised. The chance is</i></div>
<i> modified by charisma. You can start hating on me now.</i>
<i>-Help files for GUILD MAGIC USER, GUILD BLACK ROBE, GUILD RED ROBE, GUILD</i>
<i> WHITE ROBE and CONCLAVE TEST have been added.</i>

<i>Scout Changes:</i>
<i>-Wolverine instinct command 'an</i>
<i>ger' had its duration raised to 7 rounds, it</i>
<i> was 4 before.</i>
<i>-Grizzly instinct command 'roar' had its spell_save check on each target</i>
<i> removed. It should land a lot more often.</i>
<i>-A new scout skill 'wildfire' has been added.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 15th, 2010 part 2</i>

<i>Mage book loads have been changed to load spells for robed mages. Each</i>
<i>book currently contains 4 spells, a mage spell and a spell for each</i>
<i>colored robe. Book binding is gone, load tables are back. Its a work in</i>
<i>progress so please send me any feedback you might have.</i>

<i>Some low tier spell books will however only load a mage spell for current</i>
<i>mages. This is not a bug, and had to be done for the time being to cater</i>
<i>for (old) mages.</i>

<i>This will come into effect next reboot.</i>

<i>-- Flook</i>


<i>November 15th, 2010</i>

<i>Note: Black and Red Robe Beta is being delayed until tomorrow. Hopefuly in</i>
<i>      the morning.</i>
<i>Note: White robes might be open for beta tomorrow as well, we will see.</i>

<i>-A bunch of Dark Knight skills had typo fixes.</i>
<i>-Drain was apparently forcing mobs to automatically fire off skills. I</i>
<i> could never reproduce this issue, but I made a fix which should remove it.</i>
<i> Let me know if it is still occuring.</i>
<i>-Drain and Gaze should land more often.</i>
<i>-Gaze will lag on failure now, not just success.</i>
<i>-Stances train when you change stance types.</i>
<i>-Thrust should train in a more intelligent way.</i>
<i>-Thrust requires you to be wielding a weapon now (can't believe I forgot to</i>
<i> add this).</i>
<i>-Low level/skill thrusts should do more damage now.</i>
<i>-Dark Knights were previously set to cast spells as if they were 9 levels</i>
<i> lower than their actual level (if you were 30, you cast like a level 21).</i>
<i> I removed this restriction for the time being. I want to see how it goes,</i>
<i> we did this to Paladins a while ago. This should mean your spells (and</i>
<i> gaze) should land more often and last longer.</i>
<i>-Assail messaging should happen before the damage now.</i>
<i>-Assail penalty changed from HEALTH to REGEN.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 12th, 2010</i>

<i>The non-DK stuff:</i>
<i>-Paladins and Dark Knights will no longer lose a round of melee after</i>
<i> casting a spell.</i>
<i>-All Divine Powers (DK and Paladin) that had set a 24 tick divine power</i>
<i> cooldown now set a 6 tick cooldown. Any that weren't using the 24 will</i>
<i> remain the same.</i>
<i>-Barbarian dances will now last in rounds instead of ticks. The amount of</i>
<i> time is based on how drunk you are.</i>
<i>-Pet ranking was made easier. Pets should now gain ranks from all rank</i>
<i> mobs. The maximum pet rank was lowered from 50 to 30. No one was anywhere</i>
<i> near 30, so lowering it shouldn't affect anyone.</i>
<i>-A crazy init method was drastically increasing our boot times. I fixed it,</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 9781"><i> so boot times should come down at least a little.</i></div>

<i>DK Specific changes:</i>
<i>    The DK class has been overhauled in a lot of ways. Pretty much every</i>
<i>skill they have was touched. The spells were left mostly alone, only unholy</i>
<i>might got a big change. I am not going to be able to describe it all here,</i>
<i>so I will go over the concepts and some of the major changes.</i>

<i>--Stance:</i>
<i>    The stance skill is no longer an activated skill. It is now a toggle</i>
<i>with different types. You will always log in with no stance, you can then</i>
<i>choose between offensive, defensive and balanced stance. Each stance has</i>
<i>its own benefits. Most of the other skills that Dark Knights get will now</i>
<i>react differently based on what stance the Dark Knight is in. Those skill</i>
<i>changes are called out in the helpfiles for the most part. The skills that</i>
<i>didn't get this treatment are: the weapon skills, target, bandage and</i>
<i>march. Every other skill now has some interaction with stance. Unholy Might</i>
<i>also got changed to do different things based on your stance, but the rest</i>
<i>of the spells are untouched.</i>

<i>--New Skill Thrust added:</i>
<i>    It is mainly focused on doing damage. Play with it and tell me what you</i>
<i>think.</i>

<i>--Impair now works with any weapon:</i>
<i>    I removed the long blade requirement.</i>

<i>--Spell Slots:</i>
<i>    Dark Knights now gain their first circle of spells at level 5, second</i>
<i>at level 12, third at level 18 and fourth at level 24. Along with the</i>
<i>changes to spell circle, the number of slots has been adjusted upward. DKs</i>
<i>and Paladins should now have very similar number of spells slots at level</i>
<i>30.</i>

<i>--Skill Levels:</i>
<i>    The level which skills are gained by DKs has been rearragned. This was</i>
<i>done to make leveling a DK at lower levels more interesting. There might be</i>
<i>some wierdness for DKs that were between levels 2 and 9 before the change,</i>
<i>but it will work itself out if you keep leveling.</i>

<i>--Rescue upped:</i>
<i>    The skill cap on rescue has been raised for all DKs to the point it was</i>
<i>for Lily Knights before, and the cap on Lily rescue has been raise to match</i>
<i>warrior rescue. This will mean that if you had superb rescue before, you</i>
<i>won't have it now, but you can continue to train and get there again.</i>

<i>--Status Loss:</i>
<i>    DKs that lose status now will no longer be changed into warriors until</i>
<i>they are atoned. They will also not have to retrain their skills and</i>
<i>spells. Status loss has been changed to remove your Knight of the Lily</i>
<i>status until you re-run the quest, and you will not be able to cast spells</i>
<i>for 72 ticks after losing status.</i>

<i>--Status Loss Bug:</i>
<i>    A few people seemed to have run into a bug where they were losing</i>
<i>status with IMPUNITY up. I believe I have fixed this bug, but I couldn't</i>
<i>reproduce the issue before, so I couldn't test if I had it fixed. I made a</i>
<i>change that obviously looks like its related to the bug, so hopefully that</i>
<i>fixes the problem.</i>

<i>    These changes, like the bash, lay and Barbarian changes are a work in</i>
<i>progress. I would really like to hear feedback from you on them (use the</i>
<i>forums). Also, there might be bugs because I can't test every situation, so</i>
<i>please report anything you see that looks out of whack.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>November 10th, 2010</i>

<i>First a couple notes:</i>
<i>-Lay will now train when used on self, not just on others.</i>
<i>-Eat, Drink, Taste and Sip will now work in combat.</i>

<i>Barbarian Minor Revamp:</i>

<i>    This is a first swing at adding some life to a few barbarian skills. I</i>
<i>would be really interested in feedback on these changes after people have</i>
<i>played with them for a few days.</i>

<i>Changes...</i>
<i>1. Wardance no longer autorescues. Wardance now makes the Barbarian much</i>
<i>   weaker against incoming damage. Wardance should not be used as a tanking</i>
<i>   dance now, it is more geared toward doing damage, not taking damage.</i>

<i>2. A new skill, "into the breach", has been added. This skill gives</i>
<i>   barbarians access to the auto rescue capabilities formerly on wardance,</i>
<i>   but in any dance, or no dance at all. Once the skill is started, it</i>
<i>   continues for a few rounds. If you want to stop rescuing at any point</i>
<i>   after you start it, just use the skill again to turn it off.</i>

<i>3. Healdance had its healing increased quite a bit.</i>

<i>4. The charge skill has been overhauled. The damage should be about the</i>
<i>   same, but it should actually do damage all the time now, not do nothing</i>
<i>   a lot of the time.</i>

<i>5. The assail skill was overhauled. The learn rate was drastically</i>
<i>   increased, the damage was increased, the number of swings was increased</i>
<i>   at the lower end and it should be easier to land.</i>

<i>6. The battle cry skill was overhauled. The learn rate was made easier (its</i>
<i>   based on the number of people you hit with the cry, by the way), the</i>
<i>   affects were stacked up instead of 1 at a time. It should be more</i>
<i>   obvious what its doing, but still not plain.</i>

<i>7. Charge, Battle Cry and Assail can now all be used while dancing, in any</i>
<i>   dance. No restrictions.</i>

<i>That is what I got for now. Lets see how this works out and move</i>
<i>forward from there.</i>

<i>Bash Tweaks:</i>
<i>-Bashers affected by HASTE will now have a chance to gain 2 rounds of lag</i>
<i> instead of always only getting 1 round of lag.</i>
<i>-The damage calculations for bash have been tweaked again, mostly lower.</i>

<i>Lay Skill Revision:</i>
<i>-Lay is now usable before the full duration of the cooldown at a reduced</i>
<i> power level. The power levels are tiered and the tier you are will be</i>
<i> available in your score while lay is still on cooldown.</i>
<i>-You can now lay as often as every 6 ticks, but only at a 25% power of a</i>
<i> full lay.</i>
<i>-There is also a 12 tick, 50% power lay, as well as an 18 tick, 75% power</i>
<i> lay.</i>
<i>-Reduced power lays will learn at the same rate as full power lays, so you</i>
<i> don't need to wait out the duration to get a possible train.</i>
<i>-Lay is still very difficult to get to superb. This cannot change until the</i>
<i> playerwipe, sorry.</i>

<i>    The White Robe alpha test is starting today. This means that mortal</i>
<i>alts of level 31+'s will be playing the class in all aspects of the game,</i>
<i>including pvp. They should not be randoming, but if they are attacked or</i>
<i>otherwise involved in a legitimate hunt, they are free to pvp as they see</i>
<i>fit.</i>

<i>    White Robes use some mechanics that are new the game, so you may see</i>
<i>some odd and interesting things. Feel free to report anything you believe</i>
<i>is a bug. The faster we get through the de-bugging of White Robes, the</i>
<i>faster we get to the player wipe most of you have been begging for</i>
<i>incessantly.</i>

<i>    The current plan, which may change, is to open the Red Robes and Black</i>
<i>Robes for beta (meaning everyone can make one) a week from today, on Monday</i>
<i>November 15th. This date may slip, so don't get angry if its later in the</i>
<i>week.</i>

<i>IMPORTANT CHANGE -- PLEASE READ</i>

<i>There are 2 major changes here, both work together.</i>

<i>First,</i>
<i>    Scrolls can no longer be recited while sitting. You will have to be</i>
<i>standing to recite a scroll. Potions are unchanged. You can still recite</i>
<i>scrolls on someone who is sitting, as long as you are standing.</i>

<i>Second,</i>
<i>    The bash skill has gotten a major overhaul. I will detail the changes</i>
<i>below. All of the changes work together, so please read them all, they are</i>
<i>not in order of importance.</i>

<i>1. Shield Quality no longer affects your chance to land a bash.</i>
<i>-The quality will still exist on the item, but it will now only influence</i>
<i> the damage done by the bash, not the chance to land the bash.</i>

<i>2. Dexterity is now important for bashing.</i>
<div class="t 9828"><i>-The dexterity of the basher and the dexterity of the target are both now</i></div>
<i> important. The higher the better. A higher dex basher has a greater chance</i>
<i> of landing a bash, a higher dex target has a great chance of avoiding a</i>
<i> bash.</i>

<i>3. Bashing someone that is sitting suffers no skill penalty.</i>
<i>-It will work just like bashing someone that is standing for the most part</i>
<i> (more on this in a moment).</i>

<i>4. The BASH_MOD stat still exists and works the same way.</i>

<i>5. Charmies will suffer a skill penalty to bash based on their level.</i>
<i>-The lower level they are, the larger the penalty.</i>

<i>And the big one...</i>
<i>6. The lag caused by a bash has been split up and changed.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 10047"><i>-The basher will still suffer a 2 round lag whether they land the bash or</i></div>
<i> not. Missing the bash still forces them to sit.</i>
<i>-The target will only ever suffer a 1 round lag from being hit by a bash.</i>
<i>-If the target is standing when they are bashed, they be given a 2 round</i>
<i> "trouble standing" affect. What this does is make it so they suffer a 1</i>
<i> round lag after standing. They can stay on the ground and wait out the</i>
<i> affect, then stand with no lag.</i>
<i>-If the target is sitting or resting (or stunned) when bashed, they are not</i>
<i> given the "trouble standing" affect. They can stand with no lag whenver</i>
<i> they want.</i>

<i>    The intent of these changes is to put a bit more strategy into the</i>
<i>basher/bashee relationship. The bashee now has a choice to stand</i>
<i>immediately and take a round of lag, or wait a bit and not lag. The basher</i>
<i>has to decide how to time that second bash to best keep their target locked</i>
<i>down. If you have 2 bashers locking down one target, they will need to</i>
<i>stagger their bashes to keep the person floored. All of this tied together</i>
<i>with the reciting scroll changes should make PK and zoning a little more</i>
<i>interesting.</i>

<i>    Keep in mind this is a test period with these changes. There are</i>
<i>probably going to be a few bugs or situations I didn't think of that need</i>
<i>addressing.</i>

<i>    Also keep in mind that this can all change back or change to something</i>
<i>else entirely. I think this system has merit and we are going to give it at</i>
<i>least a few weeks worth of trying.</i>

<i>    Your opinions are always welcome, but please try these changes out</i>
<i>before you slam or praise them. Do not just read this news post and start</i>
<i>spouting off. Think before you spew.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>

<i>    The distinction between a Hero and a Greater Hero among the immortals</i>
<i>is being removed. This is a promotion for everyone who was a Hero before,</i>
<i>nothing will change for everyone else. For now, they will all list in "who"</i>
<i>as Greater Hero, next reboot they will all start listing as Hero, like it</i>
<i>was a few years ago.</i>

<i>      Lucky bone charms should now be less rare. They are, however, also</i>
<i>   somewhat less lucky.</i>

<i>September 13th, 2010</i>

<i>    The Black Robe alpha test is starting today. This means that mortal</i>
<i>alts of level 31+'s will be playing the class in all aspects of the game,</i>
<i>including pvp. They should not be randoming, but if they are attacked or</i>
<i>otherwise involved in a legitimate hunt, they are free to pvp as they see</i>
<i>fit.</i>

<i>    While Red Robes were somewhat similar to the current mage class, Black</i>
<i>Robes are going to be using a few new mechanics and some pretty powerful</i>
<i>abilities. You may see some wierd stuff, please feel free to bug report</i>
<i>stuff that looks out of place.</i>

<i>    When the Black Robe alpha test is over (which wont be for a few weeks</i>
<i>at least) we will look at opening both Red and Black Robes up for beta</i>
<i>testing, so that all of the players can get access to them. White Robes</i>
<i>will be a slightly longer process because of some real life issues of mine</i>
<i>over the coming weeks.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>September 10th, 2010</i>

<i>    One of the new black robe skills caused a pretty major rewrite to how</i>
<i>memming is handled in the code. The end result should be no change for</i>
<i>everyone except black robes, but if you notice any thing odd please bring</i>
<i>it up to an immortal or use the bug command to report it.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>September 9th, 2010</i>

<i>    Mostly this reboot was about getting a bunch of new black robe stuff in</i>
<i>game. The black robe alpha test should start either tomorrow or Monday</i>
<i>depending on how motivated I am to finish up the last few things.</i>

<i>One thing that will be visible to most people:</i>

<i>--The SPELL_POWER affect has changed names to SPELL_SAVES_MOD. It still</i>
<i>  does exactly the same thing, except now the name is a bit more</i>
<i>  descriptive. The old name was really confusing to everyone. I only</i>
<i>  mention this because of the purchasable ranks for this that some people</i>
<i>  have bought and might not have been sure what it was doing for them.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>September 3rd, 2010</i>

<i>--The spell 'energy drain' has been completely rewritten. It is now more of</i>
<i>  a standard damage spell with a chance of debuffing the target for a long</i>
<i>  time. There is no more experience loss when hit with energy drain. There</i>
<i>  is also no more extra experiene gain from using the spell. The long term</i>
<i>  debuffs can still be removed with restoration, etc.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>September 1st, 2010</i>

<i>--The concentration skill will now train past poor only while in combat.</i>
<i>--The group command had a new field added: iMT, which stands for Ignore</i>
<i>  Mass Teleport. This will allow groups to know who does and who does not</i>
<i>  have the ignore_mass_teleport option set. This should make use of the</i>
<i>  spell slightly easier for group leaders.</i>
<i>--There were some changes to the way haste interacts with scout instincts.</i>
<i>  The net result should be no change from before. If you notice anything is</i>
<i>  off or wrong please point it out.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>August 30, 2010</i>

<i>Stronghold blacksmiths now share a common inventory list. This means items</i>
<i>sold at one can be purchased at all other stronghold smiths. This inventory</i>
<i>is also preserved over reboots or crashes, but items will be destroyed if</i>
<i>they are not purchased after a certain period.</i>

<i>There will also be new shopkeepers appearing in towns over the next few</i>
<i>days to allow non-clanned characters to purchase from the same inventory</i>
<i>list.</i>

<i>A bug preventing purchase has been fixed. Please report any further issues.</i>
<i>-- Wratha</i>

<i>August 27th, 2010</i>

<i>-A new prompt option has been added (HELP PROMPT) called spellcraft. This</i>
<i> option is only going to work and be useful for robed mages, so you can</i>
<i> ignore for it now. I wanted to point it out so people aren't confused.</i>
<i>-The spell 'soul protection' had its duration changed to a straight 2</i>
<i> ticks.</i>
<i>-The spell 'malevolent tentacles' had its damage type changed to</i>
<i> negative-energy. This change is part of the upcoming black robe class, but</i>
<i> it is applied to the current mages as well. Over the remainder of the wipe</i>
<i> some of the higher level immortals will be reviewing any gear with the</i>
<i> IMMUNE_NEGATIVE_ENERGY flag and removing a bunch of them. Also, quite a</i>
<i> few mobs will be changed to lose their immunity to negative energy. The</i>
<i> intent here is to allow negative energy to be a more commonly used damage</i>
<i> type and not have everyone immune to it.</i>
<i>-Object fragging has been lowered for quite a number of damage type::object</i>
<i> material combinations. Specifically acid and lightning damage types had</i>
<i> their frag on objects lowered. The other types were lowered as well, but</i>
<i> acid and lightning got the biggest changes.</i>

<i>Small News:</i>
<div class="t 10094"><i>-Clairvoyance should be fixed for non-robed mages.</i></div>

<i>Big News:</i>

<i>    Red Robe alpha testing is starting today. This means that there will be</i>
<i>mortals of level 31+s playing the class in all aspects of the game,</i>
<i>including pvp. Please treat them like normal players, but if you think you</i>
<i>notice a bug, mention that to them and/or use the bug command to report it.</i>

<i>    We will be doing a beta test on Red Robes where they are open to anyone</i>
<i>wanting to try them out, but we first have to re-work all of the spell</i>
<i>loads for mages to allow for red robe spells to load. This is going to take</i>
<i>a bit, so please be patient.</i>

<i>Related News:</i>

<i>    Due to the nature of robed mages and one of their skills, spellcraft,</i>
<i>more components need to be in circulation. So, at some point today or</i>
<i>tomorrow I will be increasing the component drop rates across the board.</i>

<i>    A strange cemetery has been sighted just north of Port Balifor, and it</i>
<i>  seems quite out of place. Reports abound of undead creatures roaming</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 10281"><i>  about, particularly one which is reported to be wearing a hockey mask.</i></div>
<i>    Further investigation is unwise, but for those who would do so anyway a</i>
<i>  brave group of friends would be of great benefit to you.</i>
<i>    The cemetery won't stay long, so anytime before Monday would be good.</i>

<i>Bleed and die,</i>
<i>- Kam & Rafo</i>

<i>August 10th, 2010</i>

<i>-The INT to MEM factors were changed again. This time toward shorter mem</i>
<i>  times. This should be close to the end of these changes, if not the last</i>
<i>  one.</i>
<i>-The ignore_mass_teleport helpfile was fixed.</i>
<i>-Wratha fixed a memory leak that has been causing us headaches.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>August 5th, 2010</i>

<i>-There were some changes in the methods used for assails target, but it</i>
<i> should work the same way. If you notice anything funny with assail please</i>
<i> let someone know.</i>
<i>-The spell 'stone skin' should no longer lose duration (and thus a single</i>
<i> use) from ticks that happen while the stone-skinned player is in combat.</i>
<i>-Magic missile damage was upped a bit at lower levels again. It should be</i>
<i> the same at higher levels. This was mostly done to make the damage</i>
<i> calculation easier to read for me.</i>
<i>-The INT bonus for memorization was reduced a little bit. It is still better</i>
<i> than it was a month ago, just not as good as it has been recently.</i>
<i>-A new player option is now available: IMMUNE_MASS_TELEPORT see help option</i>
<i> immune_mass_teleport, although there isn't much info there.</i>

<i>*A little more info about this: Red Robes will have a spell, mass teleport,</i>
<i>which has the potential cause a lot of craziness and grief. This option</i>
<i>will allow you to not be teleported by it if a red robe in your group casts</i>
<i>it. Newly created characters will have this turned on by default, but all</i>
<i>old characters will have to turn it on manually.</i>

<i>02 August 2010</i>

<i>     Yesterday was the beginning of a very popular week in our real world.</i>
<i>  People around the world gather to watch on in horror and awe at amazing</i>
<i>  creatures as they twist and thrash through the water. Since 1987 this</i>
<i>  has been happening and it occured to Rafo and I that we here on Arctic</i>
<i>  should not resist this great tradition any longer. And so..</i>

<i>                         WELCOME TO SHARK WEEK!</i>

<i>     Many sharks have appeared in the land of Krynn. Some stronger than</i>
<i>  others, and the fabled whale shark the most powerful of them all, but</i>
<i>  luckily also the most rare.</i>
<i>     As you watch the adventures of others with the sharks on television,</i>
<i>  so too can you now have adventures yourself! Sharks are to be found</i>
<i>  almost anywhere that you can find water, be it a large or small body.</i>

<i>  SHARK WEEK will continue until around the 8th of August.</i>
<i>  Enjoy chumming the waters!</i>

<i>  - Kam & Rafo</i>

<i>01 August 2010</i>

<i>Some renegade mages have appeared in several low level zones throughout the</i>
<i>land. Unless you are a magic user there is little reason to concern</i>
<i>yourself with them.</i>
<i>Pesky magic users, showing up everywhere!</i>

<i>- Kam, not a magic user, because he's a kender.</i>

<i>August 1st, 2010</i>

<i>Recent Crashes:</i>

<i>    There was a crash bug in one of the thief changes I made recently, I</i>
<i>have found and fixed it. Nothing to see here! Move Along!</i>


<i>Shocking Grasp:</i>

<i>    The damage on shocking grasp has been increased, mostly at the lower</i>
<i>levels. I am not positive I increased it enough, so please let me know how</i>
<i>it feels. This change should make leveling a mage (or magic user) at the</i>
<i>really low levels at least a bit easier.</i>


<i>Memorization Times:</i>

<i>    I have increased the memorization bonus from INT by quite a bit. The</i>
<i>memorization bonus for the phase of the moon that mages (and robed mages)</i>
<i>get has been bumped as well. Finally, the memorization bonus in</i>
<i>class-specific mem rooms for all classes has been just about doubled. The</i>
<i>intent here is to make casters more viable in the later stages of the game</i>
<i>as scouts, thieves and warriors can just keep pounding without having to</i>
<i>stop. Mostly this is a pre-emptive change for robed mages who are going to</i>
<div class="t 10328"><i>be casting a lot more from their deeper circles (7, 8 and 9), but I think</i></div>
<i>it helps out everyone to keep mem times shorter.</i>

<i>    I may have gone too far with the memorization changes and made memming</i>
<i>too fast, please let me know how this feels and if any backward tweaks are</i>
<i>needed.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>

<i>FLANK:</i>

<i>    There has been a wait state added to backstab when it is used while</i>
<i>flanking. This is a first attempt at bringing flanked backstabs more into</i>
<i>balance. This may or may not be the only change to flank, time will tell.</i>

<i>    Also, the help file for flank has been updated a bit. There was more to</i>
<i>the skill that wasn't readily apparent from the old helpfile.</i>

<i>PICK:</i>

<i>    Pick has been changed in a few ways. First off, there is now a 1 combat</i>
<i>round wait state after each attempt to pick. Secondly, the 3 game hour</i>
<i>timer between attempts to pick the same lock has been removed, you can now</i>
<i>pick the same lock repeatedly with only the 1 combat round wait state</i>
<i>between. Third, there is now a 3 game hour timer between learning pick on</i>
<i>the same lock (past poor). This last one means you can only learn once per</i>
<i>3 ticks on a single lock.</i>

<i>ROBED MAGES:</i>

<i>    Kam alluded to this in his news post, but robed mage testing is going</i>
<i>to be moving forward a bit more quickly. We are going to start alpha</i>
<i>testing on the Magic User class in the next few days and we are hoping to</i>
<i>get Red Robes into alpha sometime in the next week or two. Alpha testing</i>
<i>means that there will be 31+s with mortals testing the class in normal game</i>
<i>play. Once the alpha of a class is done we will look at getting them into</i>
<i>beta testing where anyone can make a character of that class.</i>

<i>    Magic Users are a precursor class. They will only be allowed to gain up</i>
<i>to level 10, at which point they will have to complete the conclave test</i>
<i>and choose which robed mage (Black, Red or White) they want to be. So for</i>
<i>the short term you might be seeing a lot of these running around in lowbie</i>
<i>zones. Feel free to interact with them, ask them questions, etc, but they</i>
<i>aren't required to answer anything or give you any information. You can</i>
<i>also pkill them if you feel like it, but don't make it a habit.</i>

<i>    Now that we are entering alpha there are going to be bugs, possibly</i>
<i>crash bugs, please be patient as we try to fix these as quickly as we can</i>
<i>get to them.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>

<i>   Some wizened old magic users have appeared wandering about in major</i>
<i>   cities across the land of Krynn. They are serving as temporary</i>
<i>   guildmasters for the new mage testers and shouldn't be a bother to</i>
<i>   anyone.</i>

<i>- Kam</i>

<i>July 25th, 2010</i>

<i>-I forgot to mention this in the previous news, but I fixed a bug that was</i>
<i> causing some rank experience to only be applied to one person involved in</i>
<i> the kill, not the whole group. You should all be getting the proper rank</i>
<i> experience now.</i>

<i>-Good aligned characters should no longer lose experience for killing good</i>
<i> NPCs, they should get 0 experience.</i>
<i>-Neutral Chaotic characters should no longer be at such a huge experience</i>
<i> gain disadvantage. There is still a disadvantage, but its a lot smaller.</i>
<i>-Enchant Armor and Enchant Weapon should now have output messages to the</i>
<i> caster and room. These will pass through to Enchant Item as well.</i>
<i>-The 'magic missile' spell now has a 50% chance to cast an extra missile</i>
<i> when its doing less than 5 to begin with. This change was made so lower</i>
<i> level mages are a little bit more powerful, their leveling was kind of</i>
<i> harsh until level 7.</i>

<i>The Big One:</i>
<i>    We have decided to turn 'sheafs' off for all classes (mages and</i>
<i>druids). There are plans to address trash mages and druids in other ways,</i>
<i>but those are still a little while off. In the short term we wanted to try</i>
<i>turning the spell loss system off and see how things pan out. Please feel</i>
<i>free to let us know what you think of this change on the web forums.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 10547"></div>
<i>    The caps on skill training based on wisdom system has been changed</i>
<i>significantly. There is good news and bad news related to this.</i>

<i>The Good News:</i>
<i>    There is no longer a set amount of wisdom required to get all skills to</i>
<i>'superb'. Previously there was a set wisdom number that was needed to max</i>
<i>out your skills, this number varied based on guild and each skill. That</i>
<i>system was very limited because of the binary nature of the wisdom value,</i>
<i>either you had enough, or you didn't, beyond that value wisdom was really</i>
<i>only useful to a few select guilds. While a long standing part of the game,</i>
<i>it was never a very good gameplay aspect, so it was burned to the ground.</i>
<i>Now, with the addition of legendary characters and all the 'superb' skills</i>
<i>that requires, it was decided the time for a change had come.</i>

<i>The Bad News:</i>
<i>    The wisdom caps are still there, but now instead of stopping you dead</i>
<i>in your training tracks, training will get hard quickly. You can still</i>
<i>train, but its going to become difficult and only get harder as you</i>
<i>progress. The lower your wis, the quicker you will see it getting harder.</i>
<i>This harder training will only show up late in the training for every</i>
<i>character with 13+ wisdom. Also, the skill caps have changed, for the</i>
<i>worse. So you will start running into these training issues earlier, but it</i>
<i>shouldn't happen before 'good' skill level for anyone, and most characters</i>
<i>won't see the slow training until 'excellent'.</i>

<i>The Other Stuff:</i>
<i>    I won't go into details, but I will say that the way skill training and</i>
<i>+LEARN equipement worked has been changed.</i>

<i>    Let me know if you think something is really broken with the system,</i>
<i>but keep in mind that its not supposed to be easy to get to 'superb' with</i>
<i>low wisdom.</i>

<i>July 15th, 2010</i>

<i>-Stat rolling has changed pretty significantly. This will only affect newly</i>
<i>rolled characters, your current characters will remain the same. Please</i>
<i>read the first post at http://mud.arctic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=476 for</i>
<i>more details.</i>
<i>-Adrenaline Rush has been made easier to get to superb.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>


<i>July 11th, 2010</i>

<i>-Gaining Ranks:</i>
<i>    One of the systems in place for gaining ranks has been made quicker,</i>
<i>faster, better, more. It is one of the more obscure forms of gaining rank</i>
<i>experience, but one that almost every player runs into from time to time.</i>
<i>As a minor hint, anyone that does obscure and little run zones will find</i>
<i>they rank a bit faster.</i>

<i>-Weapon Skill Training:</i>
<i>    I refactored how weapon skills are trained a little bit. You should</i>
<i>notice that getting weapon skills from awful to poor is a lot faster, in</i>
<i>fact they should work like almost every other skill in the game up to poor.</i>
<i>This should make actually hitting something with a weapon easier, and thus</i>
<i>make training post-poor skill easier as well. On top of that change I also</i>
<i>adjusted some of the numbers in the poor to superb range of weapon skill</i>
<i>training to make it slightly easier and slightly faster.</i>
<i>    This is still a work-in-progress, so some feedback would be much</i>
<i>appreciated. If you feel like weapon skills are still training too slowly</i>
<i>(espcially below poor) or are now too quick (especially from poor to about</i>
<i>good) please let me know. You can email me (aristox@mud.arctic.org), post</i>
<i>on the forums or talk to me in game if you can catch me.</i>

<i>Thanks,</i>

<i>     With handfuls of candy corn littering the land of Krynn there has</i>
<i>  been some unrest. Not everyone has had the desired reaction to such a</i>
<i>  delightful treat, and this has created a problem. Namely the rising of</i>
<i>  the undead who have now overrun the city of Tarsis and are currently</i>
<i>  using the Thane's Palace as their base of operations. It is well</i>
<i>  fortified and the gates have been locked tight. Little is known about</i>
<i>  their intentions, apart from complete world domination, of course.</i>
<i>     We do know that they've struck a deal with the Gugenheim's and the</i>
<i>  rangers in the Tarsis Park and agreed to leave them alone (for now).</i>
<i>     Rumor has it that they are placing an agent of theirs in the city to</i>
<i>  oversee things, but how will he do that without a head, I wonder?</i>

<i>  The haunting of Tarsis will continue until 08 November, 2009.</i>


<i>Happy haunting,</i>

<i>-CoT Spikey Yutughs area has been fixed. This had been done with</i>
<i>a fairly complicated and difficult to understand spec. It is now</i>
<i>done with a simpler spec, that gives me more control. This</i>

<i>   There is nobody to thank more than Rafo.</i>
<i>      Earlier in the week as we were gearing up for the tournament and</i>
<i>   finalizing everything we hit a few problems. Chiefly among them that my</i>
<i>   internet service broke. In the week before the tournament most of the</i>
<i>   work on the arenas and the equipment was done solely by Rafo. He did an</i>
<i>   exemplary job given that he had little guidance and almost no help since</i>
<i>   I was so unavailable.</i>
<i>      On the day of the tournament, after a mad drive through half the city</i>
<i>   to find free WiFi, I logged on only to find that Rafo had already managed</i>
<i>   to set everything up and was ready to go on the first round of the Best</i>
<i>   in Class. I fixed a few problems that cropped up while he handled the</i>
<i>   majority of the workload. Then, I had to leave before we had even</i>
<i>   finished the Best in Class event. The 3v3 and 6v6 were all him. Everyone</i>
<i>   who enjoyed the event should be sure to thank Rafo for all his hard work.</i>
<i>   I even asked him to write the post-tournament news entry, which follows.</i>

<i>   So, thank you Rafo,</i>
<i>   - Kam</i>

<i>   A very special thanks to Bakr, Lyam, Starmis and Zarge for sticking</i>
<i>   through the tournament to lend a hand. Also thanks to Thun and Stor for</i>
<i>   their help keeping things going, and of course to Phred and Wratha for</i>
<i>   helping with some of the high end problems.</i>

<i>   As always, thank you to everyone who participated. We hope to keep up</i>
<i>   running special events and tournaments. With the support you showed</i>
<i>   today, it's very likely going to continue to happen.</i>

<i>   Thanks again,</i>
<i>   Rafo</i>

<i>   Also, thanks to Starmis for the tournament results website:</i>
<i>   http://mud.arctic.org/tournaments/2009_oct.php</i>

<i>September 29, 2009</i>

<i>  The tournament will be held on Sunday 04 October, 2009 beginning at 11AM</i>
<i>  system time (CST).</i>

<i>  This is the final announcement for the tournament. Please read carefully!</i>

<i>  The tournament will consist of three main events plus an exciting</i>
<i>  free-for-all round and a championship bonus round. All of these events are</i>
<i>  open to any player who is level 25 or higher.</i>

<i>  The three main events will be single-elimination style tournaments:</i>
<i>   - Best in Class: One versus One (Equipment Provided)</i>
<i>   Singles tournament for characters of the same class. One for each class.</i>

<i>   - Player Teams: Three versus Three (Equipment Provided)</i>
<i>   Teams will be chosen by players at the time of sign-up.</i>

<i>   - Random Teams: Six versus Six (Player Equipment)</i>
<i>   Teams will be randomly generated from all entrants.</i>

<i>   Standardized equipment will be provided for the Best in Class and Player</i>
<i>   Teams events. Players will use their own equipment for the Random Teams</i>
<i>   event.</i>

<i>  The sign-up process for this tournament is new and exciting. Though,</i>
<i>  because it is new, it may be a little confusing at first. Please follow</i>
<i>  these instructions as best you can, and, if in doubt, speak with a member</i>
<i>  of the tournament staff for assistance.</i>


<i>  Tournament sign-up boards have been placed throughout the game in or near</i>
<i>  most receptions. In order to sign up for the tournament you will need to</i>
<i>  post on one of these boards with the character you are signing up. If you</i>
<i>  are entering in multiple events, a different post for each event is</i>
<i>  required.</i>

<i>   - The title of your post (write <title>) should be the name of the event,</i>
<i>   for organizational purposes we have standardized these names: 3v3, 6v6,</i>
<i>   BIC.</i>
<i>   - The body of your post should give us basic information about your</i>
<i>   character in the following format: <name>, <level/rank>, <class>. For</i>
<i>   example: Kam, 35, Cleric. For the 3v3 event, only one member of the team</i>
<i>   needs to post and will need to list all three members of the team.</i>
<i>   - Here are some example posts:</i>

<i>     Message 1 (Tue Sep 29)! Kam -- BIC</i>
<i>     ----------</i>
<i>     Kam, 35, Cleric</i>
<i>     << end of message 1 >></i>

<i>     Message 2 (Tue Sep 29)! Kam -- 3v3</i>
<i>     ----------</i>
<i>     Kam, 35, Cleric</i>
<i>     Phred, 36, Ranger</i>
<i>     Rafo, 32, Warrior</i>
<i>     << end of message 2 >></i>

<i>     Message 3 (Tue Sep 29)! Kam -- 6v6</i>
<i>     ----------</i>
<i>     Kam, 35, Cleric</i>
<i>     << end of message 3 >></i>

<i>     If you find your post doesn't resemble these, you're doing it wrong.</i>
<i>     Please ask for assistance.</i>

<i>  Everyone may enter as many characters as they like in the BIC so long as</i>
<div class="t 10844"><i>  only one character for each class is entered. Also, if you are in the 6v6</i></div>
<i>  you can still be in the 3v3 and the BIC.</i>

<i>  Please find the nearest sign-up board and get yourself entered in the</i>
<i>  tournament!</i>

<i>  And, as usual, the magical viewing platform will be available for people to</i>
<i>  watch the carnage unfold.</i>

<i>May you all die.</i>

<i>Love, Kam & Rafo.</i>

<i>   fully drive away the presence of the Black Dragonarmy. The watchmen of</i>

<i>      Rumors have started circulating that an imposing knight in full</i>
<i>   ceremonial plate has been seen making the rounds of the Solamnic camps,</i>
<i>   keeping an eye out for any Crown knights that perform extraordinary</i>
<i>   deeds. The rumors claim he is very pious, stopping at every shrine to</i>
<i>   offer up a prayer or to help out some traveler down on luck. Good</i>
<i>   Knights of the Crown would do well to follow his example.</i>

<i>In honor of USA's Independence Day and France's Bastille Day:</i>

<i>    The Black Dragonarmy occupation of Port Balifor has continued for far</i>
<i>too long, according to the citizens of the city. Now tired of the continued</i>
<i>occupation of their home, they have begun to rebel quietly against their</i>
<i>evil overlords.</i>
<i>    It is believed that the lord high executioner is sympathetic to the</i>
<i>rebels and might have access to the Dragonarmy's command center in Port</i>
<i>Balifor. It is unlikely that he will reveal his sympathies to anyone who</i>
<i>does not have proof of their desire to see the city liberated.</i>
<i>    Those who seek to aid the citizens of Port Balifor should be of stout</i>
<i>heart and bring many friends.</i>
<i>    The quest will be open until the end of July, so there will be ample</i>
<i>opportunity for everyone to have a go at it.</i>

<i>- Track and hunt have been nerfed. They will both work for a much shorter</i>
<i>  distance and their effectiveness will depend on skill level. Furthermore, </i>
<i>  they can no longer be used to check for the existence of mobs or players.</i>
<i>- Several world spells like relocate, teleport, whispering wind etc can no</i>
<i>  longer be used to determine the existance of players. If this is not the</i>

<i>- Objects will be fragged at a significantly lower rate.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>  limit.</i>
<i>- The Lord of the Necropolis legendary cleric rank will also set the name of</i>
<i>  all animates to just 'corpse'.</i>

<i>For more info, read HELP LEGENDARY CHARACTERS. Note that all aspects of</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 24, 2009</i>

<i>- Fixed bug with some animated mobs giving rank exp when dying</i>

<i>- Fixed a few bugs that have been fooming us. Undoubtly more remain,</i>
<i>  but we're considerably more stable lately.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 12, 2009</i>

<i>- After numerous reports about too slow rank progress, I reviewed the ranks</i>
<i>  code. It turns out that ranking is indeed MUCH lower than last wipe, if you</i>
<i>  kill the same mobs over and over again. This IS intended, but not to the</i>
<i>  current extent. This was changed, and rank progress should be faster now.</i>

<i>  As an additional perk, rank kills history has been cleared for all players.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 10, 2009</i>

<i>I rewrote parts of the code that were slowing us down. You should notice a </i>

<i>May 9, 2009</i>

<i>- Thrash will no longer bash if the hit misses.</i>
<i>- I decided to freeze development until we fix the bugs that have been</i>

<i>stable.</i>

<i>May 6, 2009</i>

<i>- Assist without arguments will now work with (most) charmies</i>
<i>- Disorientation effects will now be visible in score</i>
<i>- Mob reaction to characters entering their room has been slightly modified.</i>
<i>  Report anything you think is broken, but be warned of the change.</i>
<i>- As you may have noticed, we have started adding Legendary ranks for</i>
<i>  some classes. It is not a bug that some classes have no Legendary ranks</i>
<i>  yet, we're still thinking about them. Everything will be ready when we</i>
<i>  open the system to the players. As an additional note, I'm working on</i>
<i>  new unique rank effects that will soon be made available.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 5, 2009</i>

<i>- Getting charmed by a mob should now prevent any flags between you and your </i>

<i>  report immediately.</i>
<i>- Evaded area spells will flag the caster properly.</i>
<div class="t 11344"><i>- Wardance rescue will no longer work in impossible situations, such as when</i></div>
<i>  the barbarian is held, blind or bashed.</i>
<i>- A glitch with envenom and detect poison was fixed.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 28, 2009</i>

<i>- All damaging focused spells will now pulse after a combat round, instead</i>
<i>  of before.</i>
<i>- Suffering any damage while focusing will break your concentration. A </i>
<i>  skill to offset this will be provided later, but it is not yet determined </i>
<i>  who and when will get it.</i>
<i>- Icestorm will be focused for 1 combat round after initial casting instead</i>
<i>  of 3. Legendary druids will get additional rounds.</i>
<i>- The unbalance skill will affect focusing same as dealing damage to the </i>
<i>  victim.</i>
<i>- The question to enable OPTION ANSI during character creation is now red :P</i>
<i>- There is good progress in legendary characters skills coding, it shouldn't</i>
<i>  be long before they're made public.</i>

<i>April 27, 2009</i>

<i>- Fixed some bugs with ranks, if you notice more let me know.</i>
<i>- HELP EXOTIC RACES added, you can have a look. It is not finalized, but</i>
<i>  it gives a pretty good idea.</i>
<i>- HELP RACE DARGONESTI, HELP RACE HALF-OGRE and HELP RACE PHAETHON added.</i>
<i>- I don't like the term 'epic' after all, so the term 'legendary' will be</i>
<i>  used instead. You can read HELP LEGENDARY CHARACTERS for a draft, but</i>
<i>  the required rank has NOT been finalized. </i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>I have blocked access from (most) TOR exit nodes due to excessive abuse. </i>
<i>If you don't know what this is, you don't have to worry about it.</i>

<i>- The help file for bash has been changed to indicate its dependency on</i>
<i>  the quality of your shield.</i>

<i>As some of you may know, during the wipe we fixed some very old and</i>
<i>very tricky bugs that were allowing bad code to keep running, corrupting</i>
<i>our data and eventually fooming us. After the fix this bad code will</i>
<i>foom faster, allowing us to intercept such bugs early| this is the reason</i>
<i>of all these fooms lately. The bulk of that old, buggy code should be fixed</i>
<i>by now, but due to the large extent of the changes more are still lurking,</i>
<i>waiting to foom us. Please issue a bug report as soon as you notice anything</i>
<i>strange. Please do NOT ask for new features at this point| we are not</i>
<i>going to add anything new until we have a stable codebase first.</i>

<i>Apart from having fixed several bugs that were fooming us, other fixes</i>
<i>since the wipe include:</i>

<i>- Your own BLOODY items should no longer zap you. Notice that it is</i>
<i>  perfectly ok to be unable to loot your friend's items if you have</i>
<i>  OPT NO_BLOODY on.</i>
<i>- The BLOODY flag on items should now expire normally.</i>
<i>- BLOODY items will not dissappear or fooms and reboots.</i>
<i>- A bug with lightning storm damage has been fixed.</i>
<i>- Paralyzed targets will now be stunned for the first round, as it was</i>
<i>  always means to be.</i>
<i>- Fireshield (and other shields) will now work normally on held targets.</i>
<i>- Wands and scrolls will now flag properly.</i>
<i>- Inspect <item> will now show you item quality.</i>

<i>Also note that Epic characters are currently unavailable| the rank will</i>
<i>be made available once we're done configuring them. It is our first</i>
<i>priority after fixing all critical bugs.</i>

<i>Welcome back! We hope you are as excited as we are for the start of the</i>
<i>fifteenth player wipe. We've been down for a few days implementing a ton</i>
<i>of changes. There are too many people to thank, but none of this would be</i>
<i>possible without the hard work of Noldor, Rorc, Starmis, Kam, Flook, and</i>
<i>Ranzin.</i>

<i>New Player Functionality:</i>
<i>* Solace and its surrounding areas have been substantially revamped</i>
<i>  (Please thank Hew, Keila, Redux & Noryl). The goal of this revamp was</i>
<i>  to create an environment in which new players will best be able to</i>
<i>  learn to play our game. This environment is created by a trifecta of</i>
<i>  numerous mobs to kill through the early levels, the hope that more old</i>
<i>  players will start in solace due to this incentive, and the</i>
<i>  implementation of Solace Guides. HELP GUIDE and HELP GUIDE FUNCTIONS</i>
<i>  for details.</i>
<i>* Please notify us with points of confusion, we are working on a new</i>
<i>  FAQ for the website, that will hopefully serve as a nice resource in</i>
<i>  conjunction with Solace Guides.</i>
<i>* In order to gain access to Solace Guides you should respond</i>
<i>  affirmative to the new prompt in character creation: Are you new to</i>
<i>  Arctic? (Y/N). This will streamline your character creation process and</i>
<i>  your arrival in Solace.</i>

<i>Player Killing:</i>
<i>* New pkill system in place. Make sure you read HELP PKILL and HELP</i>
<i>  RULES. Report any issues asap. We tried to use our imagination in</i>
<i>  testing, but obviously you guys are always better at that then we are.</i>
<i>* New option: REFUSE_BLOODY. Will prevent players from giving you</i>
<i>  BLOODY items. Will not work for group and clan members. Works for</i>
<i>  containers with BLOODY items inside. Default is on.</i>
<i>* New options: NO_BLOODY. Will prevent players from looting BLOODY</i>
<i>  items. Will not work for their own items, as well as items of group and</i>
<i>  clan members currently online. Works for containers with BLOODY items</i>
<i>  inside. Default is on.</i>
<i>* New command available to mortals: pardon. Lets them forgive people</i>
<i>  flagged to them. Must be in same room with target. Cannot be used while</i>
<i>  charmed.</i>
<i>* Peacebreakers should be disabled. If you encounter any peacebreaker,</i>
<i>  issue a bug report.</i>

<i>Classes:</i>
<i>* Hitpoints gains for mages and druids have been reduced by 1H/level.</i>
<i>* Hitpoints gains for shamans have been reduced by 0.5H/level.</i>
<i>* Kenders can now be shamans.</i>
<i>* Gully dwarf is no longer a playable race.</i>
<i>* Theiwars are only playable as an exotic race.</i>
<i>* Shamans will no longer memorize while sleeping.</i>

<i>Spell Mechanics:</i>
<i>* Several area spells will now affect only a limited number of targets.</i>
<i>* Added support for focused spells. A focused spell affects the target</i>
<i>  every combat round, as long as he remains in the same room with the</i>
<i>  caster and the caster keeps focusing on the spell. Any active command</i>
<i>  issued by the caster will break the focus. The focus will also break if</i>
<i>  the caster gets floored, held, cannot see the target or suffers</i>
<i>  significant damage.</i>
<i>* Spellbook loads for mages have changed dramatically. Essentially a</i>
<i>  hybrid system has been developed between old and new systems. The major</i>
<i>  point here is that for high level spellbooks, mages will find that</i>
<i>  their participation in getting the spellbook will be prerequisite to</i>
<i>  being able to study the book.</i>
<i>* Charm loads for shamans have changed dramatically. Charms are no</i>
<i>  longer static loads, so each mob that loads a charm can load multiple</i>
<i>  spells.</i>
<i>* Shaman charm relearns have been added to the game.</i>

<i>Skills:</i>
<i>* Control is easier to land.</i>
<i>* Hex will now flag properly.</i>
<i>* Rush removed from warriors.</i>
<i>* Frenzy will reduce healing received. Hitroll bonus increased.</i>
<i>* Divine focus has been buffed and given to Crown Knights.</i>
<i>* Some effects of bound spirits have been changed.</i>
<i>* The quality of a basher's shield will now impose a cap to the bash</i>
<i>  skill. The penalty is much less severe vs NPCs. However, it is now</i>
<i>  easier to land a sitting bash.</i>
<i>* Raising weapon skills is easier.</i>
<i>* Scribe/brew with no arguments will now show components for all</i>
<i>  spheres.</i>

<i>Spells:</i>
<i>* Ancestral blessing's chance for extra attack reduced.</i>
<i>* Omen has been tweaked (mostly buffed).</i>
<i>* Twisted fate has been buffed.</i>
<i>* Energy drain has been buffed (caster will gain more hp).</i>
<i>* The summon modifiers for group members will also apply to clan members.</i>
<i>* Summoning circle has been buffed.</i>
<i>* Word of recall will work on ungrouped clan members.</i>
<i>* Last chance will affect NPCs.</i>
<i>* Low healing bonus will no longer cause damage when healed.</i>
<i>* Paladin mounts will not be able to wield weapons. This was a bug, and</i>
<i>  was never intended.</i>
<i>* Ancestral spirit has been tweaked (mostly buffed).</i>
<i>* Paladin auras will now affect all group members, regardless of alignment.</i>
<i>* High prayer has been buffed. It is now part of the Crown path.</i>
<i>* Ice storm can be focused for a few rounds after the initial damage.</i>
<i>  The extra damage will not frag.</i>

<i>Instincts:</i>
<i>* Thrash has been buffed it significantly boosts your chance to</i>
<i>  critical hit.</i>
<i>* The effects of cope have been buffed.</i>
<i>* Cougar has been replaced by Snow Leopard. The passive effects remain</i>
<i>  the same, but ravage was replaced by freeze. Freeze can be used as an</i>
<i>  area breath that will cause severe damage, or as a single target damage</i>
<i>  attack that will cause more damage and will impose severe penalties to</i>
<i>  the target's maneuverability.</i>

<i>Ranks:</i>
<i>* Increased the number of maximum ranks to 50.</i>
<i>* All limit 1 mobs have the potential to give some rank exp.</i>
<i>* Many new rank mobs have been added with more fine tuning of their worth.</i>
<i>* Purchased ranks will always affect players, regardless of current</i>
<i>  level/exp.</i>
<i>* The cost and effects of some ranks have been changes, and new ranks have</i>
<i>  been added.</i>

<i>Epic Characters:</i>
<i>* At rank 20, and after completing a quest, players may buy the Arctic</i>
<i>  Legend rank. This will turn them into epic characters. Epic characters</i>
<i>  receive the following bonuses:</i>
<i>   - They gain access to epic-only ranks</i>
<i>   - They gain access to epic skills and spells</i>
<i>   - They gain access to epic-only quests, that will be added to the game</i>
<i>   - They have an extended selection of pretitles available to them</i>
<i>   - They can pick exotic races for when they roll for new characters.</i>
<i>     Exotic races are the theiwar, the half-ogres, the dargonesti and</i>
<i>     the kyrie. Exotic races are comparable to normal ones they do have</i>
<div class="t 11656"><i>     some perks, but it's really nothing groundbreaking in neither stats</i></div>
<i>     or racial abilities</i>

<i>Strongholds:</i>
<i>* Cost of sofa and board dropped to 50 crp.</i>
<i>* Maximum number of rooms is now 30 (static number).</i>
<i>* Cost to create a room was greatly reduced (is now 50k + 10k * rooms)</i>
<i>* Added the 'ward' asset, weakens all non-clannies in the room.</i>
<i>* A new object flag that lets specified NORENT items be stored in vaults</i>
<i>  is now available to creators.</i>
<i>* Clan members may order a stronghold innkeeper to kick players outside</i>
<i>  the room. This option is disabled if any flagged player or bloody</i>
<i>  object is currently in the stronghold, or has been in the stronghold</i>
<i>  recently.</i>

<i>Other:</i>
<i>* Charisma will now correctly cap at 28.</i>
<i>* The REFUSE_ITEMS options will be ignored for clan members.</i>
<i>* TRUE_SEEING will now work only with illusions (NOT darkness). All</i>
<i>  existing mobs and objs using the TRUE_SEEING flag have been updated to</i>
<i>  use the NIGHTVISION flag too. This means that this change will not</i>
<i>  affect players, it will just provide creators with additional options.</i>
<i>* New wear position added: MEDAL. </i>
<i>* PROMPT WATCH_COND and PROMPT WATCH_OPP_COND are now set by default.</i>
<i>* PROMPT AIM_COND and PROMPT AIM_OPP_COND are now set by default.</i>
<i>* Most bugs in the bug file have been fixed</i>

<i>Zone Changes:</i>
<i>* In an effort to evenly distribute elite equipment between zones of</i>
<i>  similar difficulty the load locations and names of some familiar</i>
<i>  objects may have changed.</i>
<i>* Revamps of Icewall Castle and Caverns of Krynn, should be available</i>
<i>  within the first ten days of the wipe. Announcements will be made.</i>
<i>* Some spells have changed load locations.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 11781"></div>
<i>As always, these changes will be evaluated during the normal course of the</i>
<i>game and adjustments will be made as seen fit. Do not hesitate to post</i>
<i>your comments on the forum, and report all issues, especially those</i>
<i>related to pkilling, as soon as possible.</i>

<i>Upcoming Changes:</i>
<i>* Personal strongholds</i>
<i>* Robed mages with Conclave Test</i>

<i>(Drop down to the news entry below this one to see the PWIPE announcement I</i>
<i>know you all care about.)</i>

<i>Very few things have been part of my life longer than Arctic. Its kind of</i>
<i>crazy to think I started playing this game back in late 1992 and I still</i>
<i>log on almost everyday.</i>

<i>That said, it should be pretty obvious to everyone that my role as head of</i>
<i>the game has lately been more symbolic than anything. Other people have</i>
<i>stepped up to fill in most of my responsibilities. I am using this news</i>
<i>entry to more formally lay out where things are at the top of the game.</i>

<i>Scrappinak has retired, this should be known to almost everyone.</i>

<i>Phred has stepped in to take over the role that Scrappinak was handling,</i>
<i>system adminstration and general go-to person on all things technical with</i>
<i>the game. Phred is also taking a much more active role in design and ideas</i>
<i>for the game.</i>

<i>Terk is remaining head of creation.</i>

<i>Adepali has been de-facto head coder for a while and will remain as such,</i>
<i>with myself and Wratha to help out if he needs it.</i>

<i>As for me, I am going to remain around as basically a figurehead. I will</i>
<i>help when needed, answer questions when asked, but mostly stay as hands off</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

<i>The short answer is the game is now being run by a Phred-Terk-Adepali</i>
<i>triumvirate and most major questions should go through one of them. The</i>
<i>three of them will be working on ideas and direction for the game together,</i>
<i>along with implementation of those ideas.</i>

<i>I hope that clarifies things.</i>

<i>PWIPE ANNOUNCEMENT</i>
<i>==================</i>

<i>On Tuesday, April 14, at 2am system time, ArcticMud will be performing a</i>
<i>complete wipe of the player and rentfiles (PWIPE) associated with the game.</i>
<i>This means that every player will be deleted from the game.</i>

<i>The game will be down for most of the week, while we perform a variety of</i>
<i>changes that can only be done in the downtime. We hope to be open to the</i>
<i>public by the weekend. The exact time we reopen to the public will be</i>
<i>announced well in advanced on our forums.</i>

<i>The changes that will occur during the wipe will be visible on the forums.</i>
<i>In the immediate short term, we will not be buffing any characters until</i>
<i>the evening of Sunday, April 12, 2009.</i>

<i>As you stumble out of bed and begin to stretch your legs from your long</i>

<i>In case you haven't noticed, Arctic has a new, redesigned web site! Check</i>
<i>it out at http://mud.arctic.org</i>


<i>February 05, 2009</i>

<i>Arctic now has a port 80 proxy that allows you to connect to the game over</i>
<i>port 80, just telnet or direct your mud client of choice to</i>
<i>proxy.mud.arctic.org port 80 and you can login as you normally would.</i>
<i>Arctic takes no responsibility if you get fired due to this.</i>

<i>The move to the new host went smoothly, and we are fully up and</i>
<i>operational. Thanks to all of those who helped stress test during the</i>
<i>transition and chaos day.</i>

<i>-Phred</i>

<i>January 29, 2009</i>

<i>For the past nine years, Arctic has been hosted and maintained at Rutgers</i>
<i>University on a box owned, operated, and donated by Scrappinak (Mark</i>
<i>Lorenc). All good things though, must come to an end and this is no</i>
<i>exception. On Saturday January 31st, 2009 arctic will be moving to a new</i>
<i>host which will be owned and operated by Phred (Will Baleson).</i>

<i>The new host is located in Dallas, TX and we will attempt to make the</i>
<i>transition as seamless as possible. Over the past week, the mud has been</i>
<i>stress testing on the new host and the few issues that had been found have</i>
<i>been fixed. We are not anticipating any new issues to spring up but if they</i>
<i>do while we are settling in, we will do our best to fix them immediately.</i>

<i>To celebrate this move, we will be hosting a chaos day saturday and sunday</i>
<i>as a stress test of the new hardware. This chaos day will require immortal</i>
<i>intervention to start, so please take a look at the updated help CHAOS.</i>

<i>What does this mean for you as the player? Hopefully very little, but</i>
<i>please take a look at the timeline and notes below.</i>

<i>Also, please take a moment to thank Scrappinak for the time, energy, and</i>
<i>bandwidth he has graciously donated over the past 9 years.</i>

<i>Timeline:</i>

<i>1-31-09 1100-1200 CST:</i>
<i>  Arctic will be coming down for an hour or two while we transfer the</i>
<i>current player information to the new host. At this time the dns will be</i>
<i>changed to point to the new box, and the new IP address will be posted on</i>
<i>the login screen of the old host if for some reason your dns doesn't</i>
<i>update.</i>

<i>1-31-09 1200-1300 CST:</i>
<i>  Arctic will reopen on the new host and will open with a 24 (or so) hour</i>
<i>chaos event (see HELP CHAOS).</i>

<i>2-1-09 1300-1400 CST:</i>
<i>  The chaos event will end, and the mud will come down for a half an hour</i>
<i>to be restored. Once this restoration is completed, the mud will continue</i>
<i>operating as normal.</i>

<i>Notes:</i>

<i>P-Wipe:</i>
<i>  No, the server move will not result in a P-Wipe. Once the code changes</i>
<i>that require a P-Wipe are complete, we will announce a timeline for this.</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 12047"><i>In the meantime, our coders are hard at work, stop asking and have fun.</i></div>

<i>Systime:</i>
<i>  The server systime is moving from EST (+5GMT) to CST (+6GMT). While this</i>
<i>won't actually change anything, you should be aware of it.</i>

<i>Latency:</i>
<i>  While the new server is located in a different region of the US than it</i>
<i>was previously, most immortal testers have reported an improved connection</i>
<i>to the new host, however YMMV and there is nothing we can do about this.</i>

<i>It is now somewhat easier to scribe/brew soul protection.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>January 7, 2009</i>

<i>Stronghold smiths will buy many items again. Some items they will not buy.</i>

<i>-Terk</i>

<i>January 1st, 2009</i>

<i>Stronghold shopkeepers will no longer buy items.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>December 1, 2008</i>

<i>- Certain commands that were interferring with certain keywords should now</i>
<i>  be fixed.</i>
<i>- Do not taunt the reaper squirrel.</i>

<i>-Wratha</i>

<i>November 28, 2008</i>

<i>Dark knights who lose their status will no longer have to wait in order</i>
<i>to run the Lily quest again.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>November 26, 2008</i>

<i>- Uniterrupted sleep across several tics will now greatly increase hp gain.</i>
<i>- New warrior skills added: danger sense and rush. I have had almost no time </i>
<i>to test them, so expect major changes or even total removal. Should you</i>
<i>notice any issues or possibilities for abuse, notify me asap.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>November 14, 2008</i>

<i>I made some changes to the ranks system to make progression easier at high</i>
<i>ranks. Under the new system:</i>

<i>- High rank mobs will grant more than 1 rank exp even after the first time you</i>
<i>kill them. This exp will diminish with each kill, but will never drop below 1 rank exp.</i>
<i>- Whenever you die, you will lose only the rank exp awarded for the _latest_</i>
<i>kill of each mob in your kill list for your current rank.</i>
<i>- Rank exp awarded for special kills (i.e. some quests) will never be lost</i>
<i>upon death.</i>

<i>There will be a test period for the new system, and adjustments will be made if</i>
<i>the ranks progression gets out of hand and balance issues arise. </i>

<i>If you notice anything strange with your current ranks or your ranks progression</i>
<i>let me know asap.</i>

<i>Player stats have been updated. Check http://mud.arctic.org/stats</i>

<i>Shaman changes:</i>

<i>- The banishment spell was removed. It sucked anyway.</i>
<i>- New skill added, banish. Hopefully it will be more useful than a spell.</i>
<i>- A new spell of significant group value has been added. Find the charm</i>
<i>  and impress your mates!</i>
<i>- Detect poison moved up to level 3</i>
<i>- Remove curse moved down to level 2</i>

<i>Cleric changes:</i>

<i>- You will hate me for this, but I removed regenerate from clerics. I want</i>
<i>  this spell to be the shaman trademark, plus it was giving too much healing</i>
<i>  power to clerics.</i>
<i>- A new high level utility spell has been added. Revealing more info would</i>
<i>  spoil the surprise :)</i>

<i>- There will be a tournament held on Sunday 09 November, 2008 from 3PM </i>
<i>  onwards.</i>

<i>  It has been some time since we've had a large-scale tournament. Now is</i>
<i>  your chance to prove to those annoying people who are so deluded to think </i>
<i>  that they could ever possibly beat you that they, in fact, cannot. Those </i>
<i>  who prevail and are crowned as champions will have their names placed on</i>
<i>  a plaque for the rest of time. While new names may be added in the future,</i>
<i>  the names of champions past will never be removed.</i>

<i>  For more information about the tournament and instructions for registering </i>
<i>  please read the board.</i>

<i>      Due to increasing pollution from the weapons factories working near</i>
<i>   Kalaman, the climate has changed for the worse over the past few</i>
<i>   decades. The result has been horrifying storms on the North Sea. Today,</i>
<i>   it is my sad duty to report that one such hurricane has completely</i>
<i>   destroyed the Village of Vogler. Even Takhisis winced as the small</i>
<i>   fishing community was overcome by a massive tidal wave that ignored</i>
<i>   constraints of good and evil and simply killed everyone not prepared to</i>
<i>   flee. Frederick's Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), run by Lord</i>
<i>   Frederick, a close friend of Lord Calof, has done everything in its</i>
<i>   power to quickly restore the area to a condition prepared for civilized</i>
<i>   life. Hopefully their efforts will be rapidly successful. Pray for the</i>
<i>   Voglerians.</i>

<i>The bad news:</i>

<i>- Soul leech will no longer trigger the field medic mental acuity effect.</i>
<i>- The charisma bonus of monstrous mantle has been slightly reduced, duration</i>
<i>  was increased.</i>

<i>The worse news:</i>

<i>- Elemental armor was removed from shamans. It was way too strong, and I</i>
<i>  feel that it doesn't fit in the shaman model I have in my mind. My</i>
<i>  apologies to all shamans who had this spell, please do not ask for any</i>
<i>  compensation.</i>

<i>The good news:</i>

<i>- The duration of heal boost was increased.</i>
<i>- A new, powerful level 8 shaman spell has been added. Details are up to</i>
<i>  you to discover.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>October 8, 2008</i>

<i>- Some of the innate shaman bonus to hitroll and damroll have been reduced.</i>
<i>- Sticks to snakes has been slightly nerfed.</i>
<i>- Shaman spirits will no longer move to their master's room automatically.</i>
<i>A new shaman skill, 'call spirits', has been added to provide the same</i>
<i>functionality.</i>

<i>  powers or with guildmasters behavior let me know asap.</i>
<i>- Righteous Indignation will now impose its faith cost when it expires,</i>
<i>  instead of upon casting. Casting the spell while already affected by it</i>
<i>  will renew its duration, but will stack the faith costs. In addition to</i>
<i>  this, the spell will automatically expire when you rent or quit the game.</i>

<i>Clan strongholds are now available. The system is still in early testing mode,</i>
<i>expect it to be tweaked and expanded as we see how it works in action. Make</i>
<i>sure you read HELP STRONGHOLD, HELP CLAN STRONGHOLD, HELP STRONGHOLD ASSETS</i>
<i>for more info.</i>

<i>Initially there will be 11 strongholds available. They can be established</i>
<i>in the following cities:</i>

<i>    Solace         Neraka            Balifor       Palanthas (x2)</i>
<div class="t 12360"><i>    Graves' End    Mt. Nevermind     Tarsis        Kalaman (x2)</i></div>
<i>    Deep Mine</i>

<i>More locations will be available soon. Note that only the chieftain of a</i>
<i>clan may establish and expand a stronghold.</i>


<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 12547"><i>Currently it will cost you 1000 CRP and a few hundreds of thousands of coins</i></div>
<i>(depending on the location) to establish a stronghold. Expect stronghold</i>
<i>prices to be tweaked| post your suggestions on the forum. Furthermore, clan</i>
<i>quests with significant CRP rewards will be introduced in the near future,</i>
<i>making it easier for smaller clans to establish their own stronghold.</i>

<i>Special thanks to Terk, Ranzin, Vegos and Leoeon, as well as to the several</i>
<i>mortals who sent me ideas and descriptions.</i>

<i>- As you may already know, we have added a new quests system that allows you</i>
<i>  to run and keep track of current and completed quests. These quests can be</i>
<i>  repeatable (like current ones) or one-time tasks. Furthermore, in addition</i>
<i>  to personal quests, clan quests will become available. Any qualified clan</i>
<i>  member will be able complete such quests or contribute to their progress,</i>
<i>  and the rewards will typically be CRP. You may use the 'quests' command</i>
<i>  to check your current quests record (See HELP QUESTS). Some clan quests</i>
<i>  may also be published on the Arctic website or some special boards, if the</i>
<i>  clan so desires. Clan chieftains may control which clan ranks may view</i>
<i>  or perform clan quests, as well as quest publishing options, by using</i>
<i>  the 'clan quests' command (See HELP CLAN)</i>

<i>  No such quests are currently available, but hopefully some will be added</i>
<i>  in the near future. A side effect of the above system will be a significant</i>
<i>  CRP bonus that we plan to award to clans the FIRST time they kill certain</i>
<i>  rank mobs.</i>

<i>- frenzy damage bonus was removed</i>
<i>- healing wave slightly nerfed in some cases</i>

<i>    Most of the changes following are directed at the Mage revamp which is</i>
<i>going on. Some of the current spells have to change for things happening in</i>
<i>the revamp. If you notice any problems with the changes please report them</i>
<i>and dont get too worried if things are a bit out of whack for a while.</i>

<i>Changes:</i>
<i>-Penalty for being hasted dropped from 500 ticks to 100 ticks.</i>
<i>-Fireball will no longer hit groupmates or the caster, even indoors. It is</i>
<i> now a normal area spell.</i>
<i>-Fireball damage reduced.</i>

<i> +dodge_chance.</i>
<i>-Dodging an attack no longer has a chance of attacking your groupmates. You</i>
<i> can still hit charmies.</i>
<i>-Shield spell changed. It is no longer -saving_spell. It is now -armor.</i>
<i>-Players and NPCs affected by SHIELD (either from the spell or an item)</i>
<i> will no longer get 100% magic missile immunity. There is a level based</i>
<i> %chance on each missile being deflected. The % is slightly higher for</i>
<i> NPCs.</i>
<i>-Some of the lower level mage spells have had a new section added to the</i>
<i> help file, Component Casting. This is for the mage revamp only and can be</i>
<i> ignored for now. More spells will have this added as time goes on.</i>
<i>-There was a bug that made the Moons only assist memorization time for</i>
<i> LAWFUL-aligned mages. This has been changed so that every sub alignment</i>
<i> (Chaotic, Lawful and Evil) gets the same bonuses.</i>
<i>-The affect of INT on memorization times has been slightly increased. You</i>
<i> should mem slightly faster than before, the increase gets more noticable</i>
<i> the higher your INT.</i>

<i>continues. This is just the first splash.</i>

<i>- Base alignment will show in clan who</i>

<i>May 15, 2007</i>

<i>- Assail has been reworked to fix some bugs. In a nutshell it will now be</i>
<i>easier to train, slightly easier to land, and will deal a little more</i>
<i>damage. You will have to wait for a few combat rounds to reuse it with</i>
<i>top effectiveness, as was always intended (but wasn't always the case).</i>
<i>- Janitors will no longer loot sheafs.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 12, 2007</i>

<i>- Creatures summoned through spells (conjured elementals, paladin/dk mounts</i>
<i>etc) will no longer drain exp if they deliver the killing blow.</i>
<i>- Mages and druids lower than level 11 will not lose spells upon death.</i>
<i>- Corpses animated through the 'animate dead' spell will now be standing when</i>
<i>summoned. Furthermore, their duration has been very slightly increased.</i>
<i>- The 'dark blessing' divine power has been buffed.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>May 10, 2007</i>

<i>- Dark knights will now benefit more from high charisma</i>
<i>- Fixed several bugs, please report any more you find</i>

<i>Note: The dk changes didn't nerf the class in any way. All the issues some</i>

<i>- HELP STAT MARCH 2007 is now available</i>
<i>- Updated player stats are available at http://mud.arctic.org/stats</i>
<i>- You may use 'store <container> contents' to store just the contents of the</i>

<i>In an effort to better prepare his forces against the increasing Solamnic </i>
<i>threat, Lord Ariakan has sent out the call for skilled (25+) dark knights to </i>
<i>join the ranks of the Order of the Lily. As discipline is of paramount </i>
<i>importance in the Order, only Lawful players may apply. Those interested </i>
<i>should seek out Drogo Ja'ar and undertake a quest to prove both their skill</i>
<i>and their dedication to the Dark Queen.</i>

<i>Several new help files are now available, read HELP PATHS, HELP EMBRACE and</i>
<i>HELP DIVINE POWERS for more details. The HELP GUILD DARK KNIGHT has also</i>
<i>been updated to reflect the changes in the class.</i>

<i>A special event is planned for tomorrow, Saturday the 21st. The exact</i>
<i>time will depend on my schedule, but it's expected to begin at around 10am</i>
<i>system time and last for several hours.</i>

<i>There is a small chance it will move to Sunday, in that case blame</i>
<i>Rorc.</i>

<i>During the event, all group limits will be lifted and anyone who wants</i>
<i>to participate will be able to.</i>

<i>The Knights of Solamnia, under the command of Steel Brightblade, have</i>
<i>staged a successful attack on the Dark Knights outpost near Palanthas, and</i>
<i>have captured or killed most of the inhabitants. A small group of Dark</i>
<i>Knights has been preparing a counter attack under the command of Lord</i>
<i>Ariakan, staging somewhere near the outpost. Rumors have it that an elite</i>
<i>unit of dark knights has been dispatched to help with the retaking of the</i>
<i>outpost, but their arrival time is unknown.</i>

<i>Those who do not want to participate in the slaughter for DKO will be</i>
<i>allowed to enjoy the Chaos Day in their own way, but keep in mind, only</i>
<i>people participating in the quest can kill each other.</i>

<i>There will be an announcement both in NEWS and MOTD once this begins.</i>
<i>At the end of the quest, the playerbase will be restored to its previous</i>
<i>state.</i>

<i>April 18, 2007</i>

<i>- Fixed a long-standing bug that caused animate dead to sometimes reload the</i>
<i>original mob's loads. I'm really pissed by the fact that it was only reported</i>
<i>now, after a long, long period of abuse.</i>

<i>- We have increased the number of available spell components in the game to</i>
<i>make it once again possible (yet still hard enough) to scibe/brew elite</i>
<i>spells. An extremely limited number of old components have changed sphere</i>
<i>and power, you should be able to tell which. Special thanks to Helati.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 17, 2007</i>

<i>You will notice that several shopkeepers specialized in arcane paraphernalia </i>
<i>now sell vellum scrolls of exceptional quality. Spellcasters may use these </i>
<i>scrolls to scribe their spells in great detail, including all the fine points, </i>
<i>annotations and references usually found in their own spellbooks. As a result, </i>
<i>said spellcasters will be able to consult their scrolls in the future in order</i>
<i>to relearn spells lost due to carelessness or misfortune.</i>

<i>In addition to the high quality vellum scroll, scribing a spell in this way</i>
<i>requires a special catalyst, as well as the usual spell components. </i>
<i>Spellcasters around the world have been known to carry such catalysts for their</i>
<i>own experiments, but to be extremely reluctant to part with them.</i>

<i>Finally, it is now possible to scribe spheres of absorption and minor globe of</i>
<i>invulnerability.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 15, 2007</i>

<i>Chieftains may now set their own rules for access to the clan vault through </i>
<i>the 'clan vault' command. Any clan member may use the command without arguments</i>
<i>to see the current policy. Chieftains may specify the minimum rank for listing, </i>
<i>storing, retrieving and maintaining the vault contents. For more info, see</i>
<i>HELP VAULT and HELP CLANS.</i>

<i>Vault commands upgraded:</i>

<i>- You may now store multiple items in the vault, just use normal multiple</i>
<i>items syntax (e.g. store all.bread, store all)</i>

<i>- You may now store containers in the vault, but note that their contents</i>
<i>will be removed first and stored seperately</i>

<i>- You may now "retrieve all" to retrieve all your stored items, and "retrieve</i>
<i>alchemy" to retrieve everything inside your alchemy compartment</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 14, 2007</i>

<i>Vaults had a major internal code rehaul, let me know of any problems you</i>
<i>encounter. As a result of that code:</i>

<i>- I have decreased the available slots for both personal and clan vaults. </i>
<i>However clan vaults and the vaults of characters with the brew or scribe skills</i>
<i>will have an extra compartment where you may store exclusively brewed potions,</i>
<i>scribed scrolls and spell components.</i>

<i>- You may store coins in the vault without creating piles and wasting slots.</i>
<i>For more info, read the updated HELP VAULT.</i>

<i>On another note:</i>

<i>- You will no longer be able to spam shoot while hasted, this was never</i>
<i>intended. On the other hand, haste will improve your archery in more subtle </i>
<i>ways.</i>
<div class="t 13578"></div>
<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 13, 2007</i>

<i>- The cost for storing items in the vaults has been greatly reduced, it is now</i>
<i>equal to renting the item equipped.</i>
<i>- The number of available slots in personal vaults has increased for high</i>
<i>leveled characters.</i>
<i>- I have added +charisma to some items, more are underway. Some of them</i>
<i>which were unlimited now have a limit.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>April 12, 2007</i>

<i>Personal vaults are now available in the banks of most major cities. You may </i>
<i>use them to store items for a few days, paying rent up-front. Notice that </i>
<i>although you may use both the new VAULT_DAYS option and the "maintain" command</i>
<i>to increase your storage period, retrieving an item prematurely will not give</i>
<i>you a refund.</i>

<i>In addition to personal vaults, clan vaults can be found next to the banks of</i>
<i>the big cities of Palanthas, Haven and Kalaman. Their function is similar to </i>
<i>that of the personal vaults, but their contents are shared for all clan </i>
<i>members. Currently clansmen, elders and chieftains can deposit and maintain</i>
<i>items in clan vaults, only elders and chieftains can retrieve them, and </i>
<i>neophytes cannot use them at all. We plan to let clans impose their own </i>
<i>restrictions in the future.</i>

<i>You will notice that you only have a limit number of slots in your vault and</i>
<i>that certain items cannot be stored at all. Both issues are open to debate,</i>
<i>but wait a few days before spamming me with ideas concerning them. Also avoid</i>
<i>storing really valuable items in the vault until the code has stabilized.</i>

<i>WARNING: The vaults are meant to be an easy way to store items instead of </i>
<i>keeping them on multies</i>
<i>they also provide some new functionality that you will</i>
<i>discover once you start using them. Keep in mind that their introduction DOES </i>
<i>NOT change our storage policy: keeping valued items permanently in the vault is</i>
<i>still considered storage and will be dealt with as such. Use your judgement.</i>

<i>      In the near future we will be introducing a new type of quest, a</i>
<i>   zone that will be spread across the map, but will be more 'permanent'</i>
<i>   than most quests. Though it is nearly 100% automated, the quest will</i>
<i>   still be run under immortal supervision, although interaction will be</i>
<i>   minimal.</i>

<i>      It will be extremely difficult, and will (at first) need a ten</i>
<i>   person group, preferably of ranked and decently equipped characters.</i>

<i>      Other rules and regulations will be stated when it is ready to</i>
<i>   begin. Please apply quickly to gain a slot, we will ten and have an</i>

<i>      This is open to all who feel up to the challenge, and groups will</i>
<i>   *not* be chosen by the players for now.</i>

<i>- Several little bugs have been fixed, or will be fixed after reboot. This</i>
<i>includes stuff like invalid component loads, dispel glitches, clan-related </i>
<i>issues etc.</i>
<i>- Please stop arguing over imaginary charisma problems. Nothing has been </i>
<i>nerfed as a result of charisma, everything you mention is a result of bad </i>
<i>rolls.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 23, 2007</i>

<i>- A new stat, charisma, has been added to the game. According to the updated</i>
<i>HELP ABILITIES:</i>

<i>"A character's Charisma score is a measure of the level of awe and respect</i>
<i>that character naturally inspires in others. This is not based solely on</i>
<i>physical appearance but is also a measure of a character's persona and</i>
<i>imposing nature. Charisma has an impact on a character's interaction with</i>
<i>both mortal and extraplanar beings, and will affect spells and powers that</i>
<i>deal with the divine or elemental planes. Additionally, skills and spells   </i>
<i>that rely on intimidating or inspiring others will be affected by this score."</i>

<i>Existing players have had their natural charisma score set to a value close to</i>
<i>its maximum possible for their race and class. New players will have to roll </i>
<i>for it normally.</i>

<i>We will be monitoring the effects of charisma, modifying them when necessary,</i>
<i>so expect changes during the wipe. Balancing a stat takes time, so be patient.</i>
<i>Items that affect charisma will start making their appearance as the balancing</i>
<i>of its effects continues. I might add charisma ranks later.</i>

<i>All players may benefit from a high charisma score in one way or another, but</i>
<i>paladins, dark knights and possibly barbarians are eventually expected to be</i>
<i>more heavily affected by it.</i>

<i>Special thanks to Chert, Ranzin and Leoeon.</i>

<i>- A new circle 7 cleric spell, regenerate, will start loading soon. Expect </i>
<i>tweaking as we evaluate its potency and adjust it accordingly.</i>

<i>- The charm spells have been significantly buffed up. Players who plan to face</i>
<i>opponents capable of charming are strongly advised to be prepared for the worst.</i>

<i>- Players may now order their charmies to retreat from a fight.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 19, 2007</i>

<i>- Spellcasters may now use the 'dispel' command to automatically dispel some </i>
<i>of their own spells. For details and restrictions read HELP "SPELL SYSTEM" and </i>
<i>HELP DISPEL. Currently this works for fly, invisibility, improved invisibility,</i>
<i>continual light and fireshield. I'm considering adding more spells in the</i>
<i>future.</i>

<i>- Using the 'arrange' command with no arguments will now put your inventory</i>
<i>in order. Read HELP ARRANGE for more info.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 15, 2007</i>

<i>The game will shutdown tomorrow at 4am system time for some code change </i>
<i>operations. The shutdown shouldn't last more than 10-15 minutes. Once the</i>
<i>game is back, some unintentional side effects of the new light spell will</i>
<i>have been fixed.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 15, 2007</i>

<i>- Clan members with the NOCLAN option on will be noted as such in "clan who".</i>
<i>- Let There Be Light! In other words, light spell has been changed, read HELP</i>
<i>SPELL LIGHT for details. Thank Chert for this.</i>

<i>current rank.</i>

<i>March 9, 2007</i>

<i>With some new code available, I have gone through and updated the</i>
<i>rent_decay timers for all items of value in the game. Many items that</i>
<i>would be considered good but not "elite" have been reverted to the old</i>
<i>system of decay. Many items coming from difficult, long, or tedious zones</i>
<i>have had their timers extended by a large amount. It is up to you as</i>
<i>players to find out which items have been affected, but overall, I think</i>
<i>everyone will be happy with these changes. If you still come across an</i>
<i>item you think is not decaying at a proper rate, please let me know.</i>

<i>In addition, some re-balancing of items has been done. Certain items have</i>
<i>had some cosmetic changes, as well as some other items having some major</i>
<i>changes. Again, these changes are up to you as mortals to find out. If</i>
<i>there are any issues, please find me in-game or e-mail me,</i>
<i>sancho@mud.arctic.org</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>

<i>- Players will notice a significant increase in their critical hit rate. Mobs'</i>

<i>This may make some previously hidden bugs reveal themselves, so please report</i>

<i>discover.</i>
<i>- Reequip will now function up to level 10 (HELP REEQUIP if you don't know</i>
<i>what this is).</i>

<i>- The critical hits extra damage has been reduced. The duration of additional</i>
<i>effects has been greatly reduced.</i>
<i>- The format of archery values in lore scrolls will now match the order of</i>
<i>the archery command.</i>

<i>-Adepali</i>

<i>March 06, 2007</i>

<i>Ok looks like the patch worked fine and no further shutdowns will be required.</i>
<i>Some additional news:</i>

<i>- I changed the critical hits system to make it easier for creators to make </i>
<i>items that will modify the chance you will either score or suffer one. Our </i>
<i>previous system was too complicated, and as a result no such items were ever</i>
<i>made - hopefully this will change in the future. </i>
<i>As a result of this change, you may notice a slight increase to the frequency</i>
<i>of critical hits scored both my players and by mobs. This will be normalized </i>
<i>as the new items enter the game, but if you believe that the current chances</i>
<i>are too high let me know.</i>
<i>As an additional note, the effect of disorientation suffered by bludgeons</i>
<i>criticals has been reduced.</i>
<i>- The duration of unholy might has been slightly increased.</i>
<i>- The penalties that dark knights suffer when they fight evil mobs have been</i>

<i>March 5, 2007</i>

<i>--- IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ---</i>
<i>The game will shutdown tomorrow at approximately 5am system time in order to</i>
<i>apply a patch to the rent files. The patch is necessary in order to make it </i>
<i>possible to increase the rent decay timers beyond their current, rather short, </i>
<i>limit. This is a complicated task, expect a game lock and a few reboots or</i>
<i>shutdowns for a while once the game is back. I don't expect the whole</i>
<i>process to take more than 30 minutes, but be patient. I will let you</i>
<i>know when everything is fine.</i>

<i>- Encumberance info added to score output.</i>
<i>- Sleeping and blind people will be able to view available immortals.</i>
<i>- Players will be able to bandage their own charmies.</i>
<i>- You will now be able to march while mounted.</i>
<i>- Passive commands (look,say etc) will no longer stop parry.</i>
<i>- Exceptionally skilled thieves will notice that previously hard-to-pick </i>
<i>locks will now be considerably easier to open.</i>

<i>A few minor news as we're preparing for bigger changes:</i>

<i>- New mages will start the game with an appropriate robe instead of the</i>
<i>stock training armor.</i>
<i>- 'spheres of absorbtion' renamed to properly spelled 'spheres of</i>
<i>absorption', help file should now work fine.</i>
<i>- Mobs will no longer generate 0 spheres.</i>

<i>February 23, 2007</i>

<i>The game will shutdown today for a few minutes to implement some changes</i>
<i>to the player files. Please be patient and expect one or two reboots</i>
<i>after it's back.</i>

<i>After the shutdown, all players who have atoned in the past will have their</i>
<i>atonement chance reset. However falling from grace will have much more</i>
<i>severe effects in the future, so try not to lose your status again.</i>

<i>Furthermore, in the next few days you may witness some players using unknown</i>
<i>or unexpected powers. They will be testers giving a try to some of our</i>
<i>future changes, so there's nothing to worry about. Do not ask them for</i>
<i>details, everything will be revealed when we're ready.</i>

<i>The New World Order</i>

<i>    I have sat at the head of this game for a long, long time now, maybe</i>
<i>too long. Over about the past year the time I have had available to devote</i>
<i>to the game has dwindled at an ever increasing pace and I think my lack of</i>
<i>presence has contributed to somewhat of a stagnation among the immortals.</i>
<i>This has lead to a staleness among the mortals as well. The pattern needs</i>
<i>to be stopped and to that end I have decided to take a step back in my role</i>
<div class="t 14094"><i>and hand off a lot of my responsibilities to other people. I will not be</i></div>
<i>leaving entirely and I will still be Head Administrator until someone steps</i>
<i>up and wants the job, but the admin role will be more as a guiding hand to</i>
<i>other people rather than an iron-fist of dictatorship.</i>

<i>In regards to all this a few people have been recently promoted:</i>
<i>-Adepali is now the head coder.</i>
<i>-Wratha is now a coder.</i>
<i>-Kam will be tournament director (organizing and running tournaments as he</i>
<i>sees fit). He is currently in the process of moving so it might be a few</i>
<i>weeks before anything gets started.</i>
<i>-Loopley is now quest director and is assembling a staff to start getting a</i>
<i>few quests going.</i>
<i>-Terk will remain head of creation.</i>
<i>-Chert has taken over the role of in-game police. All issues of</i>
<i>rulebreaking or cheating or conflicts should be run through him and his</i>
<i>team.</i>

<i>    Lots of other immortals have stepped up as well and will be</i>
<i>contributing under the direction of the people listed above.</i>

<i>    Your suggestions and ideas are welcome in all cases, please post them</i>
<i>on the web forums or use the in game commands (bug and idea).</i>

<i>    The immortal application system will also be changed. There will no</i>
<i>longer be an application, a Hero (level 31) will become more of a</i>
<i>ceremonius position. To become a Hero a character will need to get to level</i>
<i>30 and rank 10, at that point you should seek out a level 34 to talk to</i>
<i>about the promotion. The 34 will do a minor background check to make sure</i>
<i>you haven't cheated in the past in a serious way. Once the background check</i>
<i>is completed a 35 will give you level 31.</i>

<i>    With Hero becoming a ceremonius level, it will also be an easily lost</i>
<i>level. At the end of each player wipe, all level 31s will be deleted.</i>
<i>People that contribute once they hit level 31 will quickly find themself at</i>
<i>level 32 and immune to this end of wipe deletion. The point of this is to</i>
<i>reward people for accomplishing something in the mortal realm for that</i>
<i>wipe, but not for eternity and give them a reason to help the game out if</i>
<i>they want to stay in the immortal ranks. Troublemakers and miscreants will</i>
<i>be quickly deleted from the immortal ranks though, so dont look at as an</i>
<i>oppurtunity to get easy info and use it for evil purposes.</i>

<i>    The help files on all of this have not been updated yet and might not</i>
<i>be for a while, so use this news post as the policy going forward.</i>


<i>    So in conclusion, I will still be around but I want to get fresh blood</i>
<i>directing the game and hopefully bring some new vitality to the staff and</i>
<i>the players. Anyone who can get to rank 10 and wants to help out will find</i>
<i>ample oppurtunity to do so among the different needs of the game.</i>

<i>    Hopefully someday soon you will be reading in the news about my</i>
<i>retirement and the promotion of some great person to continue carrying the</i>
<i>Arctic torch forward. For now, these moves should shake the game awake and</i>
<i>maybe get us moving again.</i>

<i>    Fyit, the rank merchant, has returned to his office in the clouds.</i>

<i>    The new rank purchase setup is in. The idea behind the change is to</i>
<i>make affects overall more costly in rank points and less costly in coins.</i>
<i>What we want to accompolish with that is more rank purchase switching, so</i>
<i>players will attempt to customize for a specific fight and switch to</i>
<i>something more general for normal zoning. If the coin costs are still too</i>
<i>high for making this a common option, we are not against lowering the coin</i>
<i>costs even more.</i>

<i>    Some of the changes will be obvious (a few of the less used purchases</i>

<i>Ranks:</i>

<i>    The new ranks system is ready (for the most part) and in. For now Fyit,</i>
<i>The Rank Merchant, has been taken out and will remain out for a few days at</i>
<i>least.</i>

<i>    In the new rank system there are no longer 100 ranks, the total has</i>
<i>been reduced to 30. So that means there are at most 30 rank points to spend</i>
<i>per character. The rank purchases will also be restructured so that things</i>
<i>are genearlly going to cost more rank points to buy.</i>

<i>    The new 30 rank system is tiered differently than the previous system.</i>
<i>The setup is design to make getting to rank 20 be similar to getting to</i>
<i>rank 33 in the previous wipe. Rank 25 is meant to be more akin to getting</i>
<i>to rank 50 from last wipe. After rank 25 it will be very difficult to gain</i>
<i>ranks, the best example I can give is going from 29 to rank 30 will be</i>
<i>similar to going from rank 64 to rank 70 in the previous system.</i>

<i>    The design is intended to allow most players to get up to around rank</i>
<i>17 or 18, with only the truly dedicated players getting past rank 25. This</i>
<i>will bring the top end players and the mid-range players closer together,</i>
<i>only 8-10 rank points separating them, but still leave enough room for the</i>
<i>elites to prove their superiority.</i>

<i>    The way rank points are gained has been changed slightly as well, but I</i>
<i>will leave that to the player to figure out for themself. The 'rank mobs'</i>
<i>will be changing over time as well, with new ones being added, old ones</i>
<i>being removed and values being changed around a bit. A new part of the rank</i>
<i>line in score has been added to show what percentage of your current rank</i>
<i>you have completed.</i>

<i>Clans:</i>

<i>    The ability to increase the size of your clan has been added with two</i>
<i>additions to the clan command.</i>

<i>clan UPGRADE medium | large</i>
<i>    This will allow you to move your clan from a small to medium, a small</i>
<i>to large or a medium to large. The cost for making the upgrade is the</i>
<i>difference between the cost you paid for your current clan and the cost of</i>
<i>the upgrade size. So a small to large upgrade is 115,000 coins (140,000 -</i>
<i>25,000). The help file has more details, which also ties into the next</i>
<i>addition.</i>

<i>clan INCREASE_SIZE value</i>
<i>    This will allow you to incrementally increase the size of your clan by</i>
<i>value. Clans have an absolute maximum size of 127 characters, so you can</i>
<i>not exceed that in any way. The cost of increasing the clan size is 5,000</i>
<i>coins per slot added for every slot added below 60 and 10,000 coins per</i>
<i>slot above 60. So if you increase from 50 to 55 slots, it will cost you</i>
<i>25,000 coins. If you increase from 58 to 63 slots, it will cost you 40,000</i>
<i>coins. Unless you are for sure only ever going to add a few more slots, it</i>
<i>is always more cost effective to use UPGRADE than INCRESE_SIZE. Of course,</i>
<i>once you get to 60 slots you can only use INCREASE_SIZE.</i>

<i>    The HELP CLAN file has entries for these 2 new commands, please read</i>
<i>them.</i>

<i>    That is it for now, hopefully Fyit will be back this weekend, but</i>
<i>probably not until early next week.</i>

<i>New Wipe. New Start.</i>

<i>    As you know in the last 5-6 months the staff and the playerbase have</i>
<i>had some lengthy discourse about the game's dynamic. We know the options</i>
<i>that have been settled on to improve the game do not necessarily sit well</i>
<i>with everyone, but it is at least worth a try.</i>

<i>So in the last few days we have worked extensively to bring...</i>

<i>-A new and improved road system, allowing for quicker travel and greater</i>
<i>proximity to other players.</i>
<i>-A relimiting of some equipment that had been unlimited.</i>
<i>-A rent_decay system on most of the high end gear in the game.</i>
<i>-A variety of subtle changes to items that may have wide or small effects.</i>

<i>    From the creation side, helpfiles for all the zones that have been</i>
<i>added are now firmly in place. Other changes are for you to uncover</i>
<i>yourself.</i>

<i>    That details the general creation changes. Most of the game system</i>
<i>changes from a coding standpoint have been done for a few weeks now and</i>
<i>will continue to be done over the coming weeks (rank changes, clan system</i>
<i>upgrades, etc). So there isn't much more to be said there, just read the</i>
<i>recent news postings to learn about those changes.</i>

<i>Below is a list of the changes that are new as of today:</i>

<i>-Mages should no longer suffer a movement penalty when casting dimension</i>
<i>door, teleport or relocate.</i>
<i>-Brewed potions and Scribed scolls will now last over 3 times longer before</i>
<i>decaying.</i>
<i>-Ranks are turned off, will return shortly.</i>
<div class="t 14375"><i>-The number of hps each class (except Mages) gains per level per con point</i></div>
<i>has been reduced slightly.</i>
<i>-Mage spell 'Malevolent Tentacles' moved from 9th circle to 8th circle.</i>
<i>-Mage spell 'Clairvoyance' moved from 8th circle to 9th circle.</i>
<i>-Mage spell 'Mirror Image' moved from 6th circle to 7th circle.</i>
<i>-New mage spell 'Minor Globe of Invulnerability' added at 7th circle.</i>
<i>-Mage spell 'Confusion' moved from 7th circle to 5th circle.</i>
<i>-New mage spell 'Spheres of Absorbtion' added at 6th circle.</i>
<i>-New mage spell 'Boost' added at 6th circle.</i>
<i>-Faith gain for paladins has tripled, loss has stayed at the same rate.</i>
<i>-New paladin spell 'Righteous Indignation' added at 4th circle.</i>
<i>(This new spell allows them to sacrific some faith at the outset for a</i>
<i>period of time in which they will not lose or gain any faith at all. Thus,</i>
<i>it allows them to kill good aligned mobs with no loss. For a period of time</i>
<i>after the spell has worn off they will gain faith at a much slower rate.)</i>

<i>    We are hoping this wipe can see a general improvement in the game and</i>
<i>bring in some new players as well as bring back some of the older players.</i>
<i>We want to foster an atmosphere of competition, and to that end we will be</i>
<i>adding things over time along those lines. This is a slow process and may</i>
<i>not always go right. If you think you have a viable idea to help us achieve</i>
<i>this goal, please feel free to share.</i>

<i>    Finally, I would like to thank Terk, Rhak, Sancho, Tregar, Mieren,</i>
<i>Earli, Salcha and (reluctantly) Koi for getting the work for this wipe</i>
<i>started and mostly finished. Its pretty amazing to me sometimes how much</i>
<i>work some of us put into this little blip on the internet radar.</i>

<i>Thanks everyone, we hope you enjoy it,</i>

<i>PWIPE Date Announcment</i>

<i>You have all been begging for it, so here it is:</i>

<i>    The mud will shutdown sometime on Wednesday, July 12th. The exact time</i>
<i>is up in the air, but it will not be before 10pm EST.</i>

<i>    The mud will come back on Friday, July 14th. The estimated time of</i>
<i>opening is at 1pm EST on that Friday. This time is subject to change with</i>
<i>little or no warning.</i>

<i>Spread the news.</i>

<i>One Note:</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 14578"><i>    The rank system will more than likely be turned off for the first 2</i></div>
<i>weeks of next wipe. There isn't enough time to get the new system finished</i>
<i>and tested before the wipe. There will NOT be a long delay in getting it</i>
<i>back in like previous wipes.</i>

<i>Flame On,</i>
<i>-- Aristox</i>

<i>June 21st, 2006</i>

<i>Rent Decay:</i>

<i>    Objects decaying in rent had a few problems up until now. One of the</i>
<i>more noticable problems was some of the items decaying immediately upon</i>
<i>entering the game regardless of how long you had been out of game. These</i>
<i>problems are all fixed now.</i>

<i>-Items that are flagged RENT_DECAY will now decay only on an internal</i>
<i>schedule when the player is in rent. Entering the game will never force a</i>
<i>decay on a RENT_DECAY item, it will have been decayed sometime prior to the</i>
<i>login.</i>

<i>Groups and XP splitting:</i>

<i>    The forumla for groups gaining xp has been adjusted to make grouping</i>
<i>more favorable to xping. This will apply to any sized group, but groups of</i>
<i>2 to 6 will see the largest gains. This ONLY applies to players level 26 or</i>
<i>lower, at level 27 the splitting goes back to normal.</i>

<i>An example:</i>

<i>Group has 1 level 20, 1 level 25 and 1 level 27. Mob is worth 1000 xp.</i>
<i>Old System -> Level 20 gets 333xp, Level 25 gets 417xp and Level 27 gets</i>
<i>450 xp.</i>
<i>New System -> Level 20 gets 667xp, Level 25 gets 883xp and Level 27 still</i>
<i>gets 450xp.</i>

<i>    Those numbers and all the new calculations are done before the</i>
<i>adjustments for alignment. kill_counts and level max, so your indvidual</i>
<i>mileage may vary.</i>

<i>    The numbers may appear a bit high, so I am going to be watching things</i>
<i>and possibly making other adjustments as we go forward.</i>

<i>    The intent of this change is to make grouping at lower levels more</i>
<i>attractive and possibly get veteran players to bring newbies along with</i>
<i>them during xp sessions. Solo xp is still going to be higher on a per-mob</i>
<i>basis, but in theory the speed at which a group can kill should offset that</i>
<i>difference.</i>

<i>Flame on.</i>

<i>      Some new zones have been added to our humble game, while some old</i>
<i>   ones have been removed. We'll leave what these zones are to speculation</i>
<i>   for a couple of weeks.</i>

<i>-- Terk</i>

<i>June 12th, 2006</i>

<i>    We have begun the item changes discussed on the forum</i>
<i>(http://mud.arctic.org/node/1748). This will be a somewhat long process and</i>
<i>should be done rather randomly. We are going about it slow and</i>
<i>systematically, so one day an item will decay like it always has and the</i>
<i>next it will start decaying in rent. We are going mostly item by item, not</i>
<i>really zone by zone, so don't expect a method to our madness. Consider this</i>
<i>your only warning, if an item suddenly decays on you, well thats just the</i>
<i>breaks.</i>

<i>-- Aristox</i>

<i>June 7th, 2006</i>

<i>-Gully Dwarves are now a playable race, albeit with lower stats than you</i>
<i>may want. They are allowed to be thieves, warriors and barbarians.</i>
<i>-Qualinesti can now be paladins.</i>

<i>Stat Rolling Changes:</i>

<i>Please read HELP STAT ROLLING for an overview of how the system now works.</i>

<i>    In basic terms, the top end stats possible have been lowered (no more</i>
<i>100 pt characters) and the ability to pick your primary stat during</i>
<i>character creation has been added. The lowering of top end stats is part of</i>
<i>move to slightly weaken players. The drop was not significant, but it is</i>
<i>noticable.</i>

<i>    If you pick a primary stat, your potential total for stats is capped</i>
<i>lower than it is if you do not pick a primary stat.</i>

<i>    Play with the system, let me know what you think. The ability to select</i>
<i>your primary stat wont be available until after the 6pm reboot today.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>


<i>June 5th, 2006</i>

<i>First step PK Flag changes:</i>

<i>    With this latest reboot pk flags will now be awarded for aggressive</i>
<i>actions, not just killing. The aggro flags are shorter duration than the</i>
<i>killing flags. Example below:</i>

<i>If Denmar attacks Hekler and Hekler recalls. Hekler will be allowed to</i>
<i>attack Denmar in peace for 10 ticks.</i>
<i>If Denmar attacks Hekler and kills Hekler. Hekler will be allowed to attack</i>
<i>Denmar in peace for 48 ticks.</i>

<i>Also, case and clairvoyance will always flag you aggressive to your target.</i>

<i>      Hi everyone, in the past decade a massive lengthening of the</i>
<i>   distance between towns has been the norm. With current playerbase size</i>
<i>   maxing at around 100, we have decided to shrink these distances so as</i>
<i>   to make travel less of a burden on players. This general restructuring</i>
<i>   will be a long process that will be starting in the next week.</i>
<i>   Eventually, we hope that you notice it takes less vs to get to where</i>
<i>   you want to go. For the time being, though, just be sure that you stop</i>
<i>   using speedwalks as the roads may change at any time.</i>

<i>May 30th, 2006</i>

<i>-The spell prismatic spray is now more obviously obtainable. It was decided</i>
<i>its previous hiding spot was too difficult when no one found it in almost a</i>
<i>year. So I have moved it and made the clues more overt. Happy Hunting.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>May 23rd, 2006</i>

<i>Scouts:</i>
<i>-Lag removed from aim.</i>
<i>-Average damage raised on shoot, maxium damage should stay the same.</i>
<div class="t 14625"><i>-Headbutt extra affect is now stopped if the target is flagged MINDSHIELD.</i></div>
<i>-Headbutt extra affect now lasts rounds in or out of combat, not rounds in</i>
<i>combat and ticks out of combat.</i>
<i>-Headbutt extra affect slightly harder to land.</i>
<i>-Roar now has a save on each target.</i>
<i>-IMMUNE_FEAR now stops you from being affected by roar.</i>

<i>Clans:</i>
<i>-Promote, Demote and Remove can now work on offline clan members.</i>
<i>-Ctell and Otell permformance reworked. They should be a lot faster now.</i>
<i>-A clan-broadcast will go out when a clan member logs in or logs out.</i>
<i>-The clan chieftain now shows in the clan describe and clanlist symbol</i>
<i>commands.</i>
<i>-The # of online members, # of total members and max size of the clan now</i>
<i>shows in the clanlist, clanlist symbol and clan describe command for clan</i>
<i>members.</i>
<i>-Clan who and clan who all reformatted to be a littler prettier (you can</i>
<i>all quit your bitching now).</i>

<i>Thieves:</i>
<i>-Unbalance now has an easier time adding a STUMBLE CHANCE to standing</i>
<i>targets.</i>
<i>NOTE: Stumble Chance makes bashing sitting targets easier. Unbalancing can</i>
<i>make bashing a sitting target easier than it was before bash was changed to</i>
<i>make sitting bashes harder. I suggest you use it instead of continuing to</i>
<i>complain about how hard landing a sitting bash is right now.</i>

<i>    Please keep in mind that we are in an experimentation phase, so these</i>
<i>changes are mostly a test set. If they work fine they will stay, but I</i>
<i>could change them at anytime. Also, some of the clan changes might do some</i>
<i>wierd things, including crash the game. If you find a crash bug please</i>
<i>report it immediately.</i>

<i>Thanks</i>

<i>May 18th, 2006</i>

<i>******** NOTE *********</i>
<i>    There was a bug such that the game was not taking enough coins from the</i>
<i>person creating the clan. So if you created a clan I have taken the</i>
<i>difference from you. The differences were Small Clan: 5k, Medium Clan: 35k,</i>
<i>Large Clan: 80k. Any complaints can be sent to me (aristox@mud.arctic.org).</i>


<i>This is a long news item and most important piece of it is at the end, so</i>
<i>please read it all.</i>

<i>Clans:</i>
<i>The first phase of the clan system is now activated. You can read a little</i>
<i>more about it in the help files (HELP CLANS, HELP CLAN, HELP CLANLIST, HELP</i>
<i>CTELL, HELP OTELL).</i>

<i>The basic system is there are 4 tiers of players in a clan:</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 14828"><i>-The Chieftain is the leader. They control the clan in all ways. There can</i></div>
<i>only be 1 chieftain at a time.</i>
<i>-Elders are the officers of the clan. They can invite new players, remove</i>
<i>players, promote and demote players and talk on the officer chat (otell)</i>
<i>with each other and the chieftain, as well as use ctell to talk to the</i>
<i>whole clan.</i>
<i>-Clansman are the meat of the clan. They can only talk on clan chat</i>
<i>(ctell).</i>
<i>-Neophytes are new members. They can talk on clan chat.</i>

<i>The person that forms the clan (using CLAN CREATE) will be made the</i>
<i>Chieftain automatically. Clans have a size associated with them, defined</i>
<i>when the clan is created. Small clans can have 20 characters in them,</i>
<i>medium clans can have 40 characters and large clans can have 60 characters.</i>
<i>There will be a system at a later date to increase the size of a clan, at a</i>
<i>cost.</i>

<i>Clans consist of 3 pieces of data:</i>
<i>-The name of the clan. This is a unique piece of data and can be at most</i>
<i>128 characters long.</i>
<i>-The symbol of the clan. This has to be unique to the clan (but is case</i>
<i>senstive so Blah and BLah and BLAH are all allowed) and is the main item</i>
<i>displayed about the clan, it can be at most 4 characters long. Players in</i>
<i>the who list will appear with their clan symbol in <> before their name</i>
<i>(example: <Jerk> Hekler the Male Lumberjack). Also the symbol is what is</i>
<i>used in the clanlist command to show data on a specific clan (clanlist</i>
<i><Jerk>). The symbol will also show to_room and in scans.</i>
<i>-The description is a free form text field used to give the world a bit of</i>
<i>info about who you are as a clan. This is edittable by the Chieftain only,</i>
<i>while in peace and resting and not pk-flagged, after the clan is made using</i>
<i>CLAN EDIT_DESCRIPTION.</i>

<i>Right now this is a very simple structure and was designed to be so. We</i>
<i>want to get the bugs worked out of what we have here before moving forward</i>
<i>and adding anything else on top of the system. There are plans for a lot of</i>
<i>other things, but they have to wait.</i>

<i>The first thing to come is a tie in between the pk flag system and the clan</i>
<i>system. The details of this aren't solid yet and probably wont be for a few</i>
<i>weeks.</i>

<i>If you have any questions or comments or suggestions, feel free to post</i>
<i>them on the web-forums, the in-game boards, the idea command or email me</i>
<i>(aristox@mud.arctic.org) directly.</i>

<i>Bandage:</i>
<i>-All guilds with a really low bandage skill (mages, warriors, thieves, dark</i>
<i>knights and paladins) had the max value of the skill raised. Your skill</i>
<i>display will show as you having a lower bandage skill now, but that just</i>
<i>means your skill has more potential than before, your ability hasn't gotten</i>
<i>worse.</i>

<i>Race Names:</i>
<i>-The names of a few races have been changed: High Elves are now known as</i>
<i>Silvanesti, Wild Elves are now known as Kagonesti.</i>
<i>-A new race has been made playable, Qualinesti. They currently have the</i>
<i>same stats as Silvanesti for the most part, there is one very minor</i>
<i>difference. These will change eventually, when we rework racial stats, but</i>
<i>possibly not until the start of next wipe.</i>

<i>Experimentation Phase:</i>
<i>With the insertion of this clan system we are now going to be starting a</i>
<i>phase of the game that will see a lot of changes. That being said, over the</i>
<i>next 6 weeks or so we are going to be doing many changes directly to the</i>
<i>game that we would generally save for the downtime around a player wipe.</i>
<i>These things will be us testing out new ideas and seeing how they work,</i>
<i>making sweeping equipment and zone changes, trying out a new pkill flag</i>
<i>system, tweaking stat rolling, etc. If you run into problems, or bugs, or</i>
<i>half finished things, please report them, but dont get too upset. We are</i>
<i>doing this to make the game better in the end and hopefully have a shorter</i>
<i>downtime around the wipe.</i>

<i>I don't normally announce pwipes way in advance, but I will give you a</i>
<i>guideline for it right now. In 6 weeks, from today, if we aren't in a place</i>
<i>that is ready for a wipe I am going to give us 2 weeks to get ready or wipe</i>
<i>in the state we are in. In plainer english, this wipe has at most 8 weeks</i>
<i>left, hopefully shorter. With that out in the open, I hope when the pk flag</i>
<i>changes come in people will be more apt to, you know, actually fight and</i>
<i>thus test the system out. Of course that might just be my own pipe dream.</i>

<i>Blah Blah Blah, and all that,</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>-New char stats up (http://mud.arctic.org/stats/)</i>
<i>    (NOTE: It said previously that one person had learned prism. This was</i>
<i>     incorrect. One of the immortals was unvieled to level 30 when I ran</i>
<i>     the stat analyzer and they were counted into the spell counts. This</i>

<i>THE EGG HUNT RULES</i>

<i>-- There will be no player-killing during the egg hunt. No stealing or</i>
<i>anything that is even remotely questionable. If you aren't sure, don't do</i>
<i>it. The wrath of the bunny is a fearsome one.</i>

<i>-- Eggs may be redeemed for prizes at any time, but you may only redeem</i>
<i>eggs once. This means that you do not have to wait until the end of the egg</i>
<i>hunt to get your prizes, but that once you do get your prizes you will no</i>
<i>longer be allowed to participate. Redeeming prizes on multiple chars will</i>
<i>not be allowed. You must be at least level 10 to redeem a prize.</i>

<i>-- Each player may only turn in two of each type of egg. There are eight</i>
<i>different eggs out there and each of them will yield you a different prize.</i>

<i>-- Among the eggs placed into the game are a number of diamond eggs.</i>
<i>These eggs will not get you a prize, but instead they will secure you a</i>
<i>place in the tournament that is to take place after the hunt. More details</i>
<i>on that later.</i>
<i>**********************************************************************</i>
<i>If you find a diamond egg, report it immediately so that we can get the</i>
<i>tournament set-up ahead of time.</i>
<i>**********************************************************************</i>

<i>-- The Easter Egg Hunt will END at 12AM SYSTEMTIME. At that time all eggs</i>
<i>must be redeemed and any eggs still in the game become worthless. The tournament</i>
<i>will begin at 10PM SYSTEMTME.</i>

<i>-- Anything that you are unclear on you should ask an immortal about</i>
<i>immediately, don't assume you're right because then when you're wrong,</i>
<i>you'll cry, and we don't want to make you cry.</i>

<i>-- Don't tell anyone we did this, people might think we care, and we don't.</i>

<i>January 1, 2006</i>

<i>   Arctic celebrated the new year with the first tournament of the wipe.</i>
<i>The style was a six man free-for-all, which consisted of eight preliminary</i>
<i>heats and then two championship rounds of the heat winners to determine</i>
<i>the overall champion.</i>

<i>   While some hiccups took place over the course of the six hour</i>
<i>tournament, the heats were generally successful and exciting. 20,000 coins</i>
<i>were awarded to each heat finalist and 2,000 coins were awarded for each</i>
<i>kill made in the tournament.</i>

<i>   Out of the eight heats rose eight finalists: Kamile, Niffy, Kamile,</i>
<i>Dralan, Tarialen, Sadi, Simone, Omi, and Jenni.</i>

<i>   These eight finalists competed in two rounds of true deathmatch</i>
<i>fighting, with death costing the players rank experience. In the first</i>
<i>round Jenni looked to be in control--surviving the longest and maintaining</i>
<i>the highest number of kills.</i>

<i>   The single person to place a bet on Jenni, though, must've celebrated</i>
<i>prematurely. In the second round Jenni fell off the podium as Tarialen</i>
<i>proved himself to be stronger in his consistency.</i>

<i>   Tarialen took the most kills award with 7 kills--Jenni had 4 and Simone</i>
<i>had 2--and the best survivor award (2nd to last and last) with honorable</i>
<i>mentions for Omi and Jenni. This performance clearly distinguished</i>
<i>Tarialen as the tournament champion, and he was rewarded generously for</i>
<i>this achievement. Don't ask.</i>

<i>   Thanks to everyone for participating, I hope you all had fun, even if</i>
<i>you didn't win or get to be in a heat. This tournament never could've</i>
<i>happened without the help of Earli, Loopley, and Bakr.</i>

<i>                                   Happy New Years,</i>
<i>                                   Terk</i>

<i>December 2nd, 2005</i>

<i>   With the six month of the wipe having past, I'm going to go ahead and</i>
<i>open immortal applications. see HELP IMMORTAL APPLICATION for more</i>
<i>details. Speak to a 34+ once you have developed a well-formatted and</i>
<i>sincere application.</i>

<i>Good Luck,</i>
<i>Terk</i>

<i>Fyit the rank merchant has reopened his shop.</i>

<i>    The costs on every purchase have been redone. The rank point costs have</i>
<i>changed on some items, but not most of them. The coin costs on everything</i>
<i>have been vastly reduced.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>October 25th, 2005</i>

<i>-The spells 'stone skin', 'prismatic spray', 'power word stun' and 'globe</i>
<i> of invulnerability' have been exempted from the sheaf system. This means</i>
<i> when a mage or druid dies and drops a sheaf these spells will not be lost.</i>
<i>-The fade skill will now be affected by the SPIN flag, previously it was not.</i>
<i>-A few bugs with volley have been fixed.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>

<i>Short Version:</i>

<i>Phred out. Hoss in.</i>

<i>Long version:</i>

<i>    With real life (a woman) really distracting him, Phred (possibly not a</i>
<i>woman) has decided to take a backseat and no longer be head of creation. I</i>
<i>have promoted Hoss (a woman trapped in the body of a 12 year old boy) to be</i>
<i>head of creation. Phred has been retired but only for the time being, he</i>
<i>may yet grow a pair and return to do some work and lose the retired flag.</i>
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

<i>-Aristox (a man)</i>

<i>October 17th, 2005</i>

<i>The Good News:</i>

<i>-The percentage of spells lost on death by mages and druids was reduced to</i>
<i> 10%.</i>
<i>-Thief Skill 'dodge' has been made into a passive skill.</i>

<i> Dodge Details:</i>
<i>    All players and mobs will now have a % chance to dodge a melee attack</i>
<i>from the mob or player they are directly attacking. This chance is based</i>
<i>off your DEX and a % modifier based on guild (thieves get the highest). The</i>
<i>dex based chance alone is really low and anyone without the dodge skill</i>
<i>shouldn't expect to dodge more than 1 in 30 attacks on a regular basis.</i>
<i>    Equipment will be appearing over time that can increase anyone's chance</i>
<i>to dodge.</i>
<i>    Thieves get a bonus to dodge chance based on their dodge skill level.</i>
<i>The bonus to dodge chance is much bigger than that of the DEX stat alone.</i>
<i>Skilled thieves could dodge as many as 1 in 4 melee attacks.</i>
<i>    Remember this only works on the character you are directly fighting,</i>
<i>not all mobs attacking you.</i>


<i>The Ugly News:</i>
<i>    The old Rank system has been turned back on. After running into a few</i>
<i>problems with implementing the new system and the big job of creating all</i>
<i>the little tasks, as well as some real life issues, I have decided to delay</i>
<i>the new rank system until the start of next wipe. We will get the work done</i>
<i>this wipe and be ready for next wipe whenever that might be.</i>
<i>    The rank merchant, Fyit Ga, has been removed for now while we work on a</i>
<i>new set of rank purchase costs. I am hoping this is done by Monday the</i>
<i>24th, but that is out of my hands. He will be back soon. For now you can</i>
<i>accumlate ranks and coins in preperation of spending them as soon as Fyit</i>
<i>gets back from his vacation to Godshome.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>Aristox</i>


<i>October 14, 2005</i>

<i>A fix for the scout instincts 'roar' and 'anger' was put in place this</i>
<i>afternoon. I appreciate all those players that make the staff aware of</i>
<i>bugs or features that just are not quite right. As always, those that</i>
<i>choose to abuse game mechanics will be dealt with harshly.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>October 13th, 2005</i>

<i>Today a group of players took it upon themselves to use a bug they found to</i>
<i>their advantage, big mistake. The abuse of game mechanics is not tolerated</i>
<div class="t 15094"><i>and must always be reported, we work hard to try to keep the game bug free</i></div>
<i>as possible but we cannot possibly see everything. The result today was the</i>
<i>banning of a group of players and the deletion of all of their characters,</i>
<i>this is how serious we are about reporting bugs.</i>

<i>In short we do our best to put new classes, zones and quests into the game</i>
<i>and attempt to test every possibility but with coding involved there is</i>
<i>always the chance of a flaw, we expect you to report it and not to abuse it</i>
<i>while we resolve it.</i>

<i>October 4th, 2005</i>

<i>The area of High Clerists Tower will be unavailable to players starting on</i>
<i>Tuesday October 4th, 2005. The area is undergoing creation modifications</i>
<i>and will be available only when these are complete.</i>

<i>Any and all items from High Clerists Tower will be deleted from the game</i>
<i>on or around Friday, October 14th. This should give the holders of these</i>
<i>items sufficient snuggle time with them before they are destroyed.</i>

<i>Thank you for your patience while the area is offline.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>September 21st, 2005</i>

<i>     The area of Silvanesti should be complete and relinked to the world</i>
<i>of Krynn on Thursday, September 22nd. I will leave it up to you to find</i>
<i>out what time. Any questions or issues with the area should be immediately</i>
<i>addressed to myself in game or in email (hoss@mud.arctic.org). </i>
<i>Tolerance for abuse is, as always nil.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>September 15th, 2005</i>

<i>Items from the area Silvanesti were deleted today. The creation</i>
<i>modifications of Silvanesti are progressing rapidly and forced this change</i>
<i>of plans earlier than expected. Please do not ask a God or Immortal about</i>
<i>any missing equipment, there will be no reimbursements.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>September 8th, 2005</i>

<i>The new tablet system for druids is in.</i>

<i>Percentages may continue to be tweaked here and there for the next week,</i>
<i>but the load locations should stay as they are now.</i>

<i>-Phred</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 15297"></div>
<i>September 8th, 2005</i>

<i>-Anger redone again. Damage bonus increased, duration increased slightly,</i>
<i> reuse timer lowered slightly.</i>
<i>-The enviromental penalities on shooting a bow have been all but removed,</i>
<i> some areas still have massive penalities, some have bonuses, most are just</i>
<i> normal.</i>
<i>-Commune with nature should work while resting again.</i>
<i>-Fence should be slightly easier to train.</i>
<i>-Volley and mirror-imaged targets should work better now.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>September 2nd, 2005</i>

<i>Who should be fixed now.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>September 1st, 2005</i>

<i>-We know who is broken, fix should be coming soon-ish.</i>

<i>A Major Note:</i>

<i>    This version of the game has been built under a much newer compiler (I</i>
<i>went from using gcc2.95.2 to using gcc4.1) and thus might have some funny</i>
<i>things going on. If you see anything out of the ordinary please report it</i>
<i>via email to aristox@mud.arctic.org and I will try my best to get on it</i>
<i>right away. I expect the game to be stable, but there is no way for us to</i>
<i>test 100+ people all playing at once, so we are going live and working out</i>
<i>any kinks we find. The game has been stable on our creation port and my</i>
<i>local development port which makes me hopeful.</i>


<i>Incoming Changes:</i>

<i>1. The druid sheaf system is here. It will work exactly like the mage</i>
<i>system except the druids will be dropping 'a quartz crystal elemental</i>
<i>sphere' instead of a sheaf. So I guess it should be called the sphere</i>
<i>system. The tablet loads for druids have not been updated yet, but that is</i>
<i>coming. This will involved vastly increasing load %'s and putting each load</i>
<i>on a targetted set of mobs just like the mage system now. The stoneskin</i>
<i>quest will not be changing at all.</i>

<i>2. The skill 'commune with nature' has changed. The skill will no longer</i>
<i>require a player to remain resting to use and the affects will last on the</i>
<i>druid even after they leave nature. The new point of the skill is to allow</i>
<i>the druid to remain connected to nature even when they are far away from</i>
<i>nature. So the skill must be used in a natural setting, but the bonuses</i>
<i>will last on the druid for a long time even after they leave nature. The</i>
<i>bonuses have also been changed slightly. The intent here was to make the</i>
<i>skill easier to make use of in areas that have few natural rooms.</i>

<i>3. The bug new scouts had with training fence has now been fixed.</i>

<i>4. The anger ability of mountain scouts has changed. There were was a bug</i>
<i>in the ability that made it last far too long (ticks instead of rounds).</i>
<i>Also the size of the bonus obtained from the skill has been reduced. This</i>
<i>is a work in progress, it was vastly overpowered before and I think this</i>
<i>new version is underpowered. I am going to be watching it for a week or so</i>
<i>and coming out with another version (probably a buffed one) soon.</i>

<i>5. We are starting a process to reshape a lot of the old ranger gear into</i>
<i>scout gear. This involves allowing evil and neutral scouts to wear the gear</i>
<i>and changing some of the +hitroll and +damroll affects to +ranged_hitroll</i>
<i>and +ranged_damroll. This is going to be a slow process and dont worry, not</i>
<i>everything will be changed to ranged.</i>

<i>6. The stat bonuses for instincts were nerfed across the board again. This</i>
<i>is all part of the work to bring scouts back into balance with the rest of</i>
<i>the classes. There will be more changes to scouts going forward, although I</i>
<i>think this is the last change to the stat bonuses.</i>

<i>7. The bug some people were seeing that would result in endurance or any of</i>
<i>the instinct effects lasting far longer than they should (30+ ticks) is now</i>
<i>fixed.</i>

<i>Also, Now available:</i>

<i>and</i>
<i>help stat august 2005</i>

<i>I think that is it,</i>

<i>August 31, 2005</i>

<i>The area of Silvanesti will be unavailable to players starting on Monday</i>
<i>September 5th, 2005. The area is undergoing creation modifications (Cyan</i>
<i>as well as others) and will be available only when these are complete.</i>

<i>Any and all items from Silvanesti will be deleted from the game on or</i>
<i>around Monday September 19th. This should give the holders of these items</i>
<i>sufficient snuggle time with them before they are destroyed.</i>

<i>Thank you for your patience while the area is offline.</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>August 30th, 2005</i>

<i>    Due to some complications with the new compiler I am using the code</i>
<i>promised for today (or yesterday) is going to have to wait a day or two.</i>
<i>So, the Druid Sheaf system gets to wait a few.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>August 29, 2005</i>

<i>Sanction is back and fully operational, well at least I hope.</i>
<i>Enjoy,</i>

<i>-Hoss</i>

<i>August 28, 2005</i>

<i>The area of Sanction will be undergoing some system adjustments this</i>
<i>weekend and will be offline to players until the reboot on Monday or</i>
<i>Tuesday. The adjustments that are being made should not affect the area as</i>
<i>you know it in anyway, they are behind the scenes modifications.</i>
<i>Thank you for your patience while the area is offline.</i>

<i>August 25th, 2005</i>

<i>Druids Beware:</i>

<i>    On monday (possibly tuesday) the sheaf-system is coming to the druid</i>
<i>guild, although they wont drop sheaves, but something else. The spell loads</i>
<i>will take a bit to get updated to work more like the mage loads, but that</i>
<i>should be done within a week of the system being in.</i>

<i>    Also, the commune with nature skill will be changing, more details</i>
<i>later.</i>

<i>    The fence-training bug will also be fixed on monday or tuesday.</i>

<i>Just giving everyone a heads-up:</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>August 2nd, 2005</i>

<i>Scout Rebalancing Effort (SBE):</i>
<i>-Fence nerfed slightly.</i>
<i>-Evade had a penalty added when the evader is in melee combat.</i>
<i>-Haste will not work on instinct commands now.</i>
<i>-Damaging Instinct commands had thier damage reduced slightly.</i>
<i>-Zap will be a little harder to land.</i>

<i>Other Stuff:</i>
<i>-The bug with studying a sheaf that isn't yours was fixed.</i>
<i>-Unbalance should land on a lot momre mobs now. There was a barrier to it</i>
<i> working on a vast majority of the high level mobs in the game and that</i>
<i> barrier was smashed to bits.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>July 25th, 2005</i>

<i>    So we had to restore from 5am system time 7/24. We apologize for any</i>
<i>inconvience but it had to be done. Sancho has also been restored and we</i>
<i>sincerely apologize for that, it is a terrible situation we know.</i>

<i>    If you want to bitch and moan, please contact the closest Hero and go</i>
<i>to town.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>July 7th, 2005</i>

<i>-The stat bonuses associated with scout instincts have been reduced.</i>
<i>-The score command for scouts with instincts activated has been changed.</i>
<i>-A message has been added when the ability for a scout to quell an instinct</i>
<i> or add a new instinct has returned. It is the same message for both</i>
<i> situations.</i>
<i>-Messaging redone for the bite, headbutt, scrape and zap instinct</i>
<i> abilities.</i>

<i>*Notice*</i>
<i>-Dun Mir should be ready for players again very soon (Monday at latest).</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>July 5th, 2005</i>

<i>    For all of you scouts, quivers are indeed acting a little "strange" at</i>
<i>the moment. The issues is being looked into and will be fixed as soon as</i>
<div class="t 15344"><i>possible. Thanks for all of the bug reports on the topic.</i></div>

<i>June 29th, 2005</i>

<i>    New scouts will now enter the game with a training axe primary and a</i>
<i>training whip offhand. They will also have a training bow in their</i>

<i> [return for more, q to stop]</i>
<div class="t 15625"><i>inventory, but will have no shield.</i></div>

<i>-If you run out of arrows you will automatically stop auto-shooting.</i>
<i>-You will not be able to shoot with anything in your hands except a bow.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>June 28th, 2005</i>

<i>SCOUTS</i>

<i>*NOTE* Scouts will not currently start with a training bow. The merchants</i>
<i>       will sell a cheap one for newbies to use.</i>

<i>    Well the day has finally arrived. I feel like I have been working on</i>
<i>this guild for years, mostly because I have been. There was almost a year</i>
<i>there where I put the guild on the shelf and didn't touch them. Somehow</i>
<i>they came back up and got rolling again and I for one am glad that</i>
<i>happened.</i>

<i>    I will let the helpfiles describe the class, so please read them before</i>
<i>you get going. HELP GUILD SCOUT, HELP PATH and HELP ARCHERY are a good</i>
<i>place to get started. A lot of the helpfiles wont be available until you</i>
<i>get the skills/abilities needed for them, so read as you go.</i>

<i>    The class is ready for players, but is not finished. I can't say that</i>
<i>strongly enough. There are going to be tweaks. There are going to be things</i>
<i>added. The balancing is done, but only on the PvE side, I am positive there</i>
<i>will be problems with PvP and there are going to be changes made when those</i>
<i>issues arise.</i>

<i>    Right now there are 3 paths (Sky, Ocean and Mountain) that are</i>
<i>available for play. We will be adding more at later times, but for now</i>
<i>these are going to be it. Also, once you choose a path you are stuck in</i>
<i>that path forever. This will be changing at some later date, but for now</i>
<i>you will have to deal with what you pick at the start. The path changing</i>
<i>system will not be easy, so dont assume you will be changing paths often.</i>

<i>    The arrows are not fully developed yet. For now mobs will not be</i>
<i>loading arrows at all, you will have to buy all of your arrows from the</i>
<i>scout merchants in town. At a later date we will have arrows done and they</i>
<i>will start loading randomly around the world on all sorts of mobs. We will</i>
<i>also be adding different types of arrows at some point (mostly with magical</i>
<i>add-ons like fireballs and disorientations). Then at some point we hope to</i>
<i>add a fletching skill to let scouts make their own arrows. And finally we</i>
<i>would want to add a way for druids (probably only druids) to add magical</i>
<i>affects to the arrows that have been made by scouts. So there is a lot left</i>
<i>to do on arrows, but that is all on the back burner until ranks are done.</i>

<i>    Please report any bugs you find via the bug command or the Bugs forum</i>
<i>on the web-boards. If you feel the need you can also email me</i>
<i>(aristox@mud.arcitc.org) directly with the bug.</i>

<i>    I would really like to thank everyone that helped develop this class,</i>
<i>but there are too many to name, so I will just mention that Phred, Koi,</i>
<i>Terk and Vespin have been instrumental in the final push to get this class</i>
<i>out. All of the immortals that tested the class last wipe were invaluable</i>
<i>in giving advice and finding issues and complaining about the things they</i>
<i>didn't like (most of which got changed).</i>

<i>I hope you enjoy them,</i>
<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>June 27th, 2005</i>

<i>    Relocation Sickness has been changed (mostly removed). It will now only</i>
<i>disallow claiming of a lost sheaf. This means that relocating or dimension</i>
<i>dooring will now prevent claiming your sheaf, but you will be able to cast</i>
<i>relocate, dimension door or teleport just fine after using these spells.</i>
<i>You will also be able to quaff and recite after casting those spells.</i>

<i>    The theory we are now working on is that the penalty of losing spells</i>
<i>on death will curb some of the mage bombing we have seen in the past. If</i>
<i>this proves wrong and mage bombing becomes an oft-used tactic yet again,</i>
<i>these changes will be rolledback.</i>

<i>-Aristox</i>

<i>June 24th, 2005</i>

<i>-Impair will be easier to train from awful to poor.</i>
<i>-Scout tweaks.</i>

<i>    For the last two and half years Noryl has been leading the creation</i>
<i>efforts of this game and has done a great job keeping everything up and</i>
<i>running. Today he has stepped aside due to time constraints and I for one</i>
<i>would like to thank him for all the work he has done over the years. He</i>
<i>will be staying around to help out, but in a more limited capacity. If you</i>
<i>see him around thank him for everything he has done.</i>

<i>    Phred will now be stepping up into the role of Head of Creation for the</i>
<i>entire game. With his work over the last couple of years and his great work</i>
<i>leading the creation effort during the downtime before this wipe I think he</i>
<i>will do a wonderful job.</i>

<i>    Koi will also be moving into a level 36 position to oversee mortal and</i>
<i>immortal affairs. This will allow me to spend more time designing and</i>
<i>coding things for the game. Koi has been doing this job in all but name for</i>
<i>a while now, so nothing has changed but his spot on the wizlist.</i>

<i>    Scrappinak and I are not going anywhere, this is just a little re-org</i>
<i>at the top of immortal tree to make things work a little smoother.</i>

<i>June 14th, 2005</i>

<i>    A potion of knowledge has been added to the magic shop (or shop selling</i>
<i>recalls) in most of the starting towns across the continent. This potion</i>
<i>will work exactly like a scroll of legend lore, except it is a potion and</i>
<i>can only be used on the character quaffing it. These potions sell in the</i>
<i>50-70 coin range and are provided to allow easier and cheaper access to</i>
<i>your character's stats.</i>

<i>    With the new lore level we thought this might be helpful.</i>

<i>Enjoy,</i>

<i>As a result of my little stnank, all characters that were affected were</i>
<i>restored to 9:48AM EST. Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience.</i>

<i>There were a handful of characters that will require additional attention</i>
<i>and I will be finding you and contacting you as soon as possible.</i>

<i>- Chemosh</i>

<i>June 7th, 2005 -- SuperCrash Followup</i>

<i>If you have not already emailed Scrappinak and you lost a character during</i>
<i>todays SuperCrash(tm), please do so now and CC the email to</i>
<i>chemosh@mud.arctic.org.</i>

<i>We have created placeholder characters for every character that was lost,</i>
<i>and when it is time, the player of that character will be given the</i>
<i>password to log the character in. When the character is logged in you will</i>
<i>go through the character creation process as if you are starting a new</i>
<i>character and you will have the freedom to change the gender and race of</i>
<i>your character, but if you pick a different guild, your coupon for one free</i>
<i>restore will be voided. After you log in, we will set your stats, skills</i>
<i>and spells to what they were prior to the crash. If your character is a</i>
<i>caster, please learn your level 1 spells from your guildmaster after you</i>
<i>are created... it will save us a little bit of work, and with as much as we</i>
<i>have to do, every little bit counts.</i>

<i>Because it is impossible to tell exactly what everyone had, we will not be</i>
<i>restoring equipment. This is necessary and unavoidable and we apologize for</i>
<i>the inconvenience, but we are putting our best effort into turning this</i>
<i>around.</i>

<i>Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience this whole mess has caused.</i>
<i>Except to Sancho.</i>
