look of elation. She holds the bracelet delicately in her pale hands,
admiring its beauty for a moment. Then, she turns towards you and says:

Oh, thank you so much! You cannot possibly understand how important this
bracelet is to the stability of the sea elven kingdom. My brother will now
be able to use its magical capabilities to see into the future, allowing
him to assume kingship as the rightful heir to the throne. I must now
return to my homeland posthaste and give him this bracelet. I won't be
needing these steel coins anymore| please, take them as a small token of my
gratitude.

Flashing you a dazzling smile, Selana closes her eyes and begins to chant
in the spidery language of magic. Seconds later, she is enveloped by a
bright flash of light and disappears.

For helping to retrieve Selana's bracelet and thus ensuring stability in
the Dargonesti kingdom, you receive 70000 experience.
