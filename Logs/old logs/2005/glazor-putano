breaks through the earth and grabs a hold of you before you have time to
react. The hand begins to squeeze the life out of your body. Just when you
begin to lose a grasp on life a booming voice fills the area.

'Grunch, Halt!'
'Spare that one, put my new pupil some place dry.'

With that, the voice disappears and the hand rears back, apparently to let
you down. Just as you begin to feel safe, Grunch catapults you with a
mighty heave. As your flight begins, you start to fall asleep and dream of
better days.

Just when you are about to give up, something rubs against your finger and
you decide to make a hasty exit from the clay. Before you have time to
react, something grabs your arm and pulls your whole body into the moist,
disgusting clay.

You are tugged along only for a few seconds, when the ride is over you are
full of clay and can hardly see anything. After wiping the clay from your
eyes you get a bearing on your surroundings. You are underground, for there
is no sun, but that is all you know.

and splash (yes splash) straight through the surface of the rock. You are
amazed only for a second, because after a brief trip through what appeared
to be water, you are flying through the air again. After a very brief
flight, you are unceremoniously dumped onto your butt. Peering around you
notice the sand and water, this must be a beach of some sort.
