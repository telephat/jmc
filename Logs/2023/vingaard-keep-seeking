VINGAARD KEEP
=============

BACKGROUND:

Vingaard Keep had long been a bastion for the Solamnic Knighthood, dating
back to the Rose Rebellion in 1791 PC. It was the center of activity for
the Knighthood, housing the lord knights and the garrisons that once
flourished all over Ansalon. The keep stood as a symbol of the power of
Paladine's watch over the forces of Takhisis.

Yet the colorful banners fly no more. In the years following the Cataclysm,
the Solamnic Knights were detested for their seemingly careless attitude
toward the people, and were forced out of their lands. Commoners stormed
the outposts of the Knighthood, stealing what they could and burning what
they couldn't. While Vingaard Keep was spared from the worst abuse, it was
nonetheless ransacked and severely damaged in places.

With the news of the Dragonarmies' approach, Lord Tankreed of Vingaard
invited the Knighthood back to the keep where no knight had set foot for
decades. Unfortunately, the Knighthood could spare only a small garrison
for the keep, not nearly the amount the Lord desired. Thus the keep that
once housed hundreds of knights is now defended by but a handful.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The keep is located atop a fortified hill, making it particularly difficult
to attack. Although held by only a handful of knights, assaulting the keep
directly could prove to be quite a bloody endeavor. Only adventurers of the
greatest ability [27+] should attempt to penetrate into the keep, as the
knights are known for their bravery and extreme skill in combat.

LOCATION:

Vingaard Keep is located atop a hill overlooking the City of Vingaard to
the north, and the Vingaard River to the east.

ILLYOC SWAMP
============

BACKGROUND:

For untold decades and generations, the Illyoc swamp was much like any
other swamp. It was filled with swarms of insects, unusual plants rumored
to be like animals, and lizards of every kind. About the only two things
that made the Illyoc swamp at all unique were the large dragon that roamed
through the murky waters and the rumors of a dark skinned race of elves who
by all accounts held an outpost somewhere deep in the marshland. All that
would change with the passing of two simultaneous events.

On the eve of the birth of his three daughters, the father of the Crytic
Druids beheld a star falling from the heavens. Never able to come to peace
with the omen, he kept the knowledge from all concerned, and especially his
daughters Ariel, Egalia, and Tatiana. As the sisters grew, their interests
and alignments started to diverge radically. Ariel was the only one of the
three to embrace the druidic ways, her sister Egalia finding comfort in the
goodness of the clerical profession, and her other sister Tatiana finding
power in the evil circles of magedom.

When he judged his daughters old enough, the Crytic father told them of the
falling star on the day of their birth. Feeling that their divergent ways
could only resolved by finding the star, he then sent the three out of the
safety of the Crytic Forest. By the time Crytic was attacked, the sisters
were long since gone. They empathically journeyed to the Illyoc swamp, the
fallen star beckoning to them each in its own way. There they disappeared
from the realm, never to emerge again.

LOCATION:

At one time the swamp was high in the mountains, defying all traditional
definitions of where it should be. Following the fall of the dark star, the
swamp slipped into a valley in the same mountains. All that is known is the
valley lies south of Palanthas, somewhere near the Fyzian village.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

Judging from the tales of when the Crytic father sent his daughters out, it
has been assumed that mid-level adventurers [12-16] could survive within
the Illyoc swamp, but very little is known about the dragon or other
creatures within the swamp. Surviving the swamp alone at that level would
probably prove impossible.
