Temple, this Gargoyle looks to have an intelligence the others lack. His
body is smaller than his brethren, and his muscles less developed, though
you suspect that he more than makes up for it in intelligence. Even with a
smaller appearance, you can see an almost literal fire burning behind his
eyes, which makes his appearance even more nightmarish. Burned onto the
back of each of his hands is the symbol of the Gargoyle Clans, a snake
wrapped around a shining sword.

of nobility and stature matched by few. It's armour-like skin looks
untarnished by previous battles, giving weight to his appearance as more
than a soldier. Chiseled into the center of his chest is the symbol of the
Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's wings. Even though its body is
made from red crystal, you can almost see a pair of light red eyes
watching you through the slit of his helmet.
An Aurinite lord is in an excellent condition.

of the light cast by your torches. This portion of the prison feels somehow
unnaturally cold, a cold that pierces through your armor and flesh, chilling

in your mind as to what keeps the prisoners from fleeing. Peering into the

dragging on the ground, but has been neatly trimmed and ends with a diamond
edged blade.
