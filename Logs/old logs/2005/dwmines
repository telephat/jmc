carved piece of crystal instead of something more human. Chiseled into his
shoulder is the symbol of the Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's
wings.

Order lack, this Aurinite was obviously born for the pursuits of the mind
and not for combat. His light yellow crystal body looks almost like a long
robe, though you can clearly make out a pair of legs below it. Before you
can react, he creates an illusionary bird which flies to you then
disappears. You can almost see a smile spread across his crystal lips
before he returns to work. Carved into the back of his robe body is the
symbol of the Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's wings.
