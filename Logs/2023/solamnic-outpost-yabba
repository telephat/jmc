Among the Tents of a Wide Encampment
    Rows of tents have been raised here, providing temporary barracks for
the Knights stationed here, and likely some living quarters for the workers
supporting them. You realize now that the camp is quite expansive, and
supports at least a company of Solamnic Knights. Past the tents, you sense
that the encampment is surrounded on all sides by a forest.

    A great tarp has been raised between a pair of tents, providing a
common meeting area for the knights of this encampment. Many chairs have
been set around a pair of long tables, upon which can be seen various
miscellaneous items, more useful to the Knights than to you. Although the
tarp overhead gives shelter from many elements, no sheets of canvas have
been draped to make walls for the tent. Lit lanterns dangle from the tarp's

A Meeting Area Between Tents
    A great tarp has been raised between a pair of tents, providing a
common meeting area for the knights of this encampment. Many chairs have
been set around a pair of long tables, upon which can be seen various
miscellaneous items, more useful to the Knights than to you. Although the
tarp overhead gives shelter from many elements, no sheets of canvas have
been draped to make walls for the tent. Lit lanterns dangle from the tarp's
supports.

    Several tents have been raised here, apparently with the intent of
supporting the warhorses of the Solamnic Knights. The ripping noise of
sawblades at work couple with the tinking of hammers to horseshoes, lending

The Livery Tent
    This tent apparently stores items of utility to the stable hands and
other workers of the camp. In one corner of the tent, bags of oats are
piled, while the rest of the tent holds the trunks and chests which stored
items now put to use in other parts of the camp. Several wagons have been
put in this tent, sheltering them from the rain, and on them are still
barrels of provisions and rolls of canvas.

The Stables
    This large tent smells of horse-sweat and leather. Around the tent's
walls are arranged various utensils of use only to stable hands, not the
least of which include rakes, brushes, shears, shovels, and the like. Many
poles rise up from the ground, making the roof of the tent rather high in
the middle. Many makeshift stalls have been constructed, and it appears

bag or barrel, and tote it past you. The floor is of planked wood, upon

Periphery of a Dense Wood
    A dark, dense forest surrounds the grassy field, and it begins to the

your sight as you look there. An encampment about you to the east and south
teems with life, in stark contrast to the quiet forest, as many people go
about their duties.

Emerging From the Forest
    The ground beneath you becomes rockier to the south, and the trees thin
accordingly. The wide face of a great rocky rise greets you not far to the

the occasional chirp of a nearby bird remind you of life in these woods
that is not at war.

registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

    Wrapped in a magically aura which the other members of the Aurinite
Order lack, this Aurinite was obviously born for the pursuits of the mind
and not for combat. His light yellow crystal body looks almost like a long
robe, though you can clearly make out a pair of legs below it. Before you
can react, he creates an illusionary bird which flies to you then
disappears. You can almost see a smile spread across his crystal lips
before he returns to work. Carved into the back of his robe body is the
symbol of the Aurinite order, a sword entangled by dove's wings.
An Aurinite alchemist is in an excellent condition.
