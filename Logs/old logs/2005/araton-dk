225H 125V 10392911X 1976C Mem:4 Exits:N> The treant appears to be just a very aged tree, towering above you and the
surrounding young trees at twenty five feet, give or take a few inches. The
bark of the tree is thick and brown, much like that of the hardwoods around
it. Huge branches extend from the middle of the tree, serving as the
treant's arms. On the trunk is what appears to be a human face, gnarled and
wrinkled from the test of time. Numerous branches protrude from just above
the face, all containing multitudes of pretty leaves. The treant speaks in
a raspy whisper. "This forest is beyond my control.. I have no quarrel with
you."
A treant is in an excellent condition.

sneaking past all the monsters to get here, but when I got to Priphea's

Sphere   : Necromantic
Usage    : cast 'Soul Protection'
Duration : 2 or ( level / 6 ) hours
Effects  : Caster's soul is protected

When this spell is cast, the caster's soul travels from his/her body to
another plane of existence where it cannot be harmed.  This means that any
attacks or affects that would normally affect the caster's soul will not
succeed as their soul is not reachable by mortal means.

beckons for you to have a seat while he explains the situation.

    "It is good that adventurers like you have come. Our situation is very
grim at the moment. You may have seen the creatures that have breached our
town gates." the man says, very assertively.

    "Four weeks ago, some of the surrounding farmlands and forests were
ravaged by a blaze we were unable to control properly. It has grown worse
since. Besides our crop yield being reduced, bizarre plant creatures
attacked our town from other surrounding forest to the north east. My men
valiantly tried to defend the walls, but we could not protect everywhere.
Many townspeople have been killed, all but a few have fled. A few of my
loyal men remain, but only enough to keep what remains of the townspeople
safe." he explains.

    "We suspect this is the work of Priphea, a druid who resides in the
forest. We have not been able to stage an assault, however. Perhaps you can
help us deliver her to justice.", continues Glaser.

    The headguard sits forward in his chair, looking you in the eye.
"Priphea was always very kind and helpful to our town, aiding our growth
and our farms when we needed it. She would call down rain during drought.
It is hard for me to think she could do such a thing, but there is no other
explanation."

    The man stands now, "I must see to some things. Come back if you need
to hear the story once more. If you are to help, I wish you luck."

his reddish brown hair is worn in standard kender topknot. He sports faded

the growth and care of the plants within the arboretum. A few of the
entries catch your attention:

--/--/--
    'I had great success with the green-white berries I've been working on.
I have already begun treating the forest with them so that they will be
more beneficial to the forest as a whole. Perhaps they can be used to help
the people of Araton as well.'

--/--/--
    'My curative berries are wonderful! I helped out a kender who wandered
into the forest and had injured his leg tripping on a root that he hadn't
seen. He was fine soon after.'

 A bit later in the journal, the writing is jagged and a bit unruly, but you can still make out some of the entries.

--/--/--
    'I can't believe that Araton would be so careless as to do that to me.
My work, my poor plants. And they don't even care!'

 (some scribbles you can't make out)

--/--/--
    'I have barricaded myself in the forest. Some, but not all of the
people of Araton have paid for their wrongdoing. I will make the rest of
them pay soon enough.'

 (more scribbles)

--/--/--
    'I have tried doing the same thing I did with the berries to other
plants, but a lot of my time has gone to my other business. My plants have
succeeded in their jobs, and my little collection is nicely placed north of
my glade. I hope the people of Araton attack me soon, so they can get what
they deserve.'

--/--/--
    'They will all die.'

    After the last entry, you notice that the journal has a small slot for
placing knick-knacks.

looks... sad. Glaser has a look of amazement on his face when he sees what
you have accomplished.

    Priphea raises her head towards the Araton Headguard, softly explaining
the past situation. The demon Baytor, the fire, her miscommunication, the
attack on the town, the killing of the town's population. She shakes her
head sadly. "I was angry... but I never wanted it to come to this... you
must understand that."

    Glaser nods to Priphea, crossing his arms. "I can forgive you for what
you have done." he begins. "-- but the law of Araton cannot. Your
punishment will have to be decided by the remaining townspeople, for that
is always as it has been. I will explain to them what has happened, perhaps
they too can forgive your error."

    Glaser tells you, "The town has great gratitude for your assistance
in our time of need, and more so for not taking the law into your own
hands." he reaches into his desk and withdraws a small bag, leaving it out
for you to take. "It is a meager reward, but all we can spare."

    Having said that, he motions for a guard to take Priphea away.
