Looking north:
The smooth stone wall is covered with a thin layer of frost.
Looking east:
Instead of the frozen underground lake that is supposed to be there, a
twisted corridor of jagged stone is visible through the the waterfall's
shimmering white veil. Strange, hideous creatures seem to be lurking
awkwardly through the twisted tunnels.
Looking south:
The southern stone wall is firm and unyielding.
Looking west:
Dark, heavy shadows stretch across the smooth stone wall.
Looking up:
The delicate icicles hanging from the ceiling appear incredibly sharp.
Looking down:
The pebbly stone floor is covered with a thin layer of frost.

 Weight   : 16           Value   : 0

As the loring magic courses through the thick bone, you see an image of
four shaded figures sitting in a circle. A fifth figure lies unconscious
on the floor in the center of the circle, clutching this bone staff close
to her chest. The rhythmic chanting of the four seated figures echoes in
your ears, and your head begins to throb painfully as their voices build
to a crescendo. Abruptly, the chanting stops, and the unconscious figure
vanishes in a puff of phantasmal light, leaving only this bone behind.

Behind an Underground Waterfall
    This small stone alcove is hidden behind the shimmering white veil of
an underground waterfall. A thin layer of frost covers the pebbly stone
floor, and delicate icicles hang from the low ceiling. The chilly air here
feels unnaturally thick and is difficult to breathe. Besides the strange
density of the air, there doesn't appear to be anything special here.
