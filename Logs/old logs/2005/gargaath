If you did not specifically win the ring, do not use it. If I find you
using it, instead of properly disgarding it, I will be very, very angry.
This tends to be bad for your health. We all seek to live in good health.

Terk, you're pronouncing a disturbing trend that leads to named items and
nonlootable corpses.
If someperson dies with someitem, this means he's not good enough to use it,
such was always Arctic's tradition.
If you wanted to give SUmack a 'character' award, you could have just as easily
done a stat increase, no?

    Seriously, what is so complicated about it? He didn't say that you
can't loot the ring, he said don't use it. That means that if the person
doesn't deserve the damn thing, you can take it and destroy it, it also
means that whoever looted it is not necessarily any better than the person
who lost it in the first place.
