A Cluttered Laboratory
    Within the confines of the small stone building is a very messy and
disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or
at least a kender) lived here, as various knick-knacks and half-finished
inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall. No one seems to be
occupying the lab at the moment.

An Ivory Step
    A raised platform that appears composed of ivory supports you from
underneath. The smooth, well-polished surface of the floor reflects your
lights as your tread over it. No ceilings or walls inhibit your movement,
and the pristine and unscuffed platform continues for quite a distance
towards the north. In the other cardinal directions, the nothingness of a
void threatens to swallow you whole. Hanging from seemingly nowhere above
the southernmost part of the step is a wooden ladder leading up.

A Hall Of Mirrors
    Light in this hallway is reflected every which way from the mirrors
that line the walls. It is difficult enough to see which way the hall goes
through the mirrors of all shapes, sizes, and angles that make up the wall.
Just in arm's reach above your head is a distinctly larger mirror than the
rest in the hall. It looks like the hall might continue to the north and to
the west.
The corpse of a mirror guardian is lying here.

these mirrors are distinctly different. In the hall below, the mirrors were

A Cluttered Laboratory
    Within the confines of the small stone building is a very messy and
disorganized laboratory. It'd be difficult to think anyone but a gnome (or
at least a kender) lived here, as various knick-knacks and half-finished
inventions and experiments are lying everywhere. The laboratory also houses
an area for more arcane developments, one can see, as a tiny table in a
corner of the lab is covered in the remains of used spell components. In
addition to that, the room is furnished with two larger tables, an anvil,
and a large firepit nestled into the eastern wall.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The General Store of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.
A grinning and grey-haired man invites potential shoppers to his stall.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A grime covered board is here.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
The clan alchemist is standing here.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
A beautiful tablet made from brilliant purple amethyst is here.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A grime covered board is here.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
<DAWN> Urtas the Male Half Ogre is standing here. (flying)
