and rage, this dragon calmly surveys its territory. Its skin is covered with
multiple overlapping plates, though some of the plates are scarred and
others have been torn away in battle. Although the dragon probably had
a collection of horns on its brow and massive nose, only a scattered collect
remain. It's claws remain razor sharp, though, and you suspect the same is
true of its teeth. Whatever battles this dragon found itself in in the past,
they obviously weren't enough to mortally wound it.
