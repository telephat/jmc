The healer looks up from his work and speaks with a sadness in his voice:

'I am glad you are here to help us, we desperately are in need of
heroes such as yourselves. The task is difficult, I hope you can do it.'

'We have always lived in peace in this vast forest, few knew that we even
existed until several weeks ago. It is then the crystal castle came. With
the arrival of the castle, our forest turned on us. The trees became
infected with some strange disease, as did my people. The nature of this
disease is so powerful that I cannot cure it on my own.'

'There is, however, something that can save us. You must find the
ingredients for a powerful healing salve that only I know of. It is a
mixture of only two things: some bark strips off the trees in the forest
and some sap from the golden tree. I sent someone out to look for these
items, but he has not returned and I fear the worst. Find him if you can,
he may have already obtained the bark.'

'The golden tree is hidden within the forest. A division of kobolds arrived
soon after the castle and took up residence in the southern part of the
forest. They have not bothered us, but I suspect they seek the golden tree
and may well have found it already. You must find the tree before they do.'

'As a final warning, the magic of the tree is very powerful. It is short lived,
but to those who use its sap, wondrous magics may be obtained. It is therefore
important you remove the kobold menace and prevent them from reaching the tree.'

The healer wishes you good luck and drops a huge chopping axe at your feet.
It is likely you will need it.

he realizes what you have in your hand. Recognizing it immediately, he
takes the salve from your hands and begins to divide it into doses. The
nurses take the doses and give them to some of the sick patients.

You watch in amazement as the effects of the healing salve take hold of
each recipient. The power of the ointment is so strong that within minutes
they are fully healed. The color returns to each villager's face and they
slowly begin to get up, having awakened from a nightmarish hell.

The healer and now-healthy villagers thank you profusely. Then the healer
begins to speak:

'Ah, I can not thank you enough. The salve you have provided shall keep
those people sick-free for the rest of their days. You have helped save the
