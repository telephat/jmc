    Arctic now supports SSL encryption. You can connect with it via
secure.mud.arctic.org:2701. I have used it effectively with the "stunnel" 
program. This program exists for many different platforms. Example:

                animus:~/stunnel $ more stunnel.conf
                client=yes

                [mud]

May 31st, 2005  - A New Hope...

Welcome to the start of yet another chapter in ArcticMUD. 

    There have been a lot of changes since you last logged in to the game.
We have spent the last week making some rather radical changes to the game,
concepts that were central to how this game player over the years have been
altered in order to level the playing field more for the unclanned and
newer players. The elite players will still have plenty to strive for, but
we spent a lot of time trying to increase the options and playability of
the game for weaker players.


The list of changes:

-Mage spells will now be lost on death.
    http://mud.arctic.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1199
-Major Equipment changes at all levels.
    http://mud.arctic.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1201
-Experience table changes at all levels.
    http://mud.arctic.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1196
-Druid spell load tables have been redone.
-The ranger class has been removed from the game.
-The bows skill has been removed from every guild.
-The crossbow items in the game are now Miscellaneous weapons.
-Relocate, Dimension Door and Teleport spells have been changed. Relocate
and Dimension Door will now flag the caster as RELOCATION_SICK. While under
the sickness the caster will not be able to cast Relocate or Teleport and
will not be able to use the Claim command (see the mage spell loss
changes).
-Clairvoyance has been changed. It will now only show the room name and
room description of the target of the spell, no player names, mob names or
object names. It will also once again work on a target anywhere in the
world. The reuse timer on the spell has been lowered to 6 ticks as well.
-Relocation Sickness will block quaffing and reciting as well.
-The bash skill has been given a higher success chance against sitting
opponents who are stumbling.
-The bash skill has been given a slightly higher success chance against
sitting opponents in general.
-Racial stat caps have been normalized so all races have the same potential
stat totals.
-Some of the quests and keywords throughout the world have been changed in
an attempt to make them more logical and match up better with the
associated clues. This is an ongoing process, please report anything you
still feel is odd with the bug command.
-Brewed Potions and Scribed Scrolls will now have an approximately 3 day
decay timer and will decay ONLY WHILE IN RENT and while in rent will decay
at the same rate as items in game. Meaning if you brew a bless potion and
immediately rent for 4 days, it will decay while you are rented.
-Ranks have been removed for now. This is our top priority going forward
with this wipe, we are going to get the new rank system off the ground as
quickly as possible. The system should be at least started within a month
and part of it available to players shortly after.
-Scouts are not in yet. This will be the 2nd priority, but will probably be
finished before ranks. I am hoping to have scouts in for player use in 2
weeks.

(Changes to the Mage Loss System):
-A sheaf will last 20 ticks if the player was recently involved in PK and
will last 60 ticks otherwise.
-The Claim command will only show the player name, not the room name, when
the sheaf is held by a player.

(Changes that Didn't Make It):
-The PVP system has not changed. I am waiting on the clan system still
which is a few weeks away hopefully.
-The clan system obviously didn't go in.

    I would like to thank (hope you would to) all the immortals that helped
get this done over the last week: Phred, Koi, Terk, Sancho, Kam, Rhak,
Salcha, Tregar, Chemosh, Vespin and Hoss (dont ask). I would also like to
thank Scrappinak for finding us a much (much, much, much) better machine to
run on and keeping this game going longer than anyone ever dreamed it
would.

    I hope you enjoy the changes that have been made so far, if something
isn't working out well we will be changing it, but for now we are going to
run with what we have. We wished we could have done a lot more, but with
the sudden nature of this wipe I am really impressed with everything we got

 [return for more, q to stop]done.

Enjoy,

    Surprise! I have some time to do the move this afternoon. The web crap
for arctic might be down for an additional day. I expect to have everything
up and going in an hour or two after downtime.

May 14th, 2005

    The below mentioned work has been postponed. It's just too nice a day
out and I have a lot of English Ivy to euthanize outside. Maybe tomorrow
or sometime during the week.

-scrappinak


May 13th, 2005 LATER THAT SAME DAY

    I'm doing a hardware upgrade of the undertone cluster tomorrow. That
means arctic gets a new facelift and stuff. I can't offer specifics on
times or durations. I'll probably have everything up before I go to bed.
This will provide many wonderful cpu cycles for killing turkeys like Mavlad.

Hope it goes well!

Stoneskin:

    The way stoneskin is acquired has been a little known secret for a few
years (okay so only I knew it). That has changed recently. We have added a
much more obvious quest setup for stoneskin in the hopes that pretty much
any druid with the patience to figure it out can obtain the spell. The
entire quest is designed to be doable on a group of 5 at most, 90% of it is
soloable.

    There are new mobs, new objects and new rooms sprinkled throughout the
game and that is about the only clue you are going to be given.

Enjoy,

Forgot to post this yesterday...

    The brew/scribe component requirements were increased for a number of
spells, in some cases significantly. I leave it to the users to figure out
which.

Scout Update:

    We are approaching the end of the bug fixing phase of scout testing.
What this means is we now have to work on balancing the class and getting
the messaging done. Once those things are finished we will move on to
writing the helpfiles and adjusting in-game gear to be usable by the class.
During the helpfile/gear adjustment phase we will be allowing mortals to
play the class. Taking a wild guess, the balancing/messaging phase will
take between 2 and 6 weeks.

    So I am hoping to have mortals playing the class sometime in early
June.

    I just wanted to give you a quick update because some people were
getting antsy and there hasn't been a news announcement in a while due to
all the work being focused on scouts.

-Aristox

March 31st, 2005

    The Help Stat <Month> <Year> files have returned. I just put up the
help stats for March 2004 until February 2005. The March 2005 file will be
put up tomorrow. Everyone thank Siria for doing the grunt work on getting
these back.

-Aristox

March 11th, 2005

     Now that Scout testing is fully underway you will notice many more
scouts wandering the roads. While i'm allowing scouts to group with anyone
I must still stress that at this time do not attack any scouts, if one
contributes to a player killing situation, whether it's assisting or
initiating, I will be removing their scout.

     At this point in time we have a few things to work out with that PVP
