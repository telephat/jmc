Several members of the gnomish aircrew guide you to a comfortable leather
chair where you sit back, and relax.

A moment later, a few shouts echo about and you feel your stomach jump as
the hot air balloon lifts off the ground. Slowly but surely the temperature
plummets as you float up into the clouds.

Frigid winds whistle about throughout your journey, however it is mostly
smooth sailing. After quite some time you feel the hot air balloon descend,
before it eventually touches down atop a large plateau on a frozen
mountainside.

A member of the gnomish air crew ushers you towards the exit and you
disembark, having arrived at your destination.
