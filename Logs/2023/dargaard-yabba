A Scorched Stone Bridge
    Out here, high above the expansive chasm below, the chilling winds that
tear through the Dargaard Mountains cut to the bone. There are no railings
on either side, so the only safe route is to stay in the very center of the
bridge. While the stones near the southern side of the chasm are relatively
grey and nondescript, those closer to the foreboding castle on the northern
side appear to have been blackened by an intense and merciless fire.

The Imposing Gates of Dargaard Keep
    The arched stone bridge ends at an imposing set of iron gates. For some
reason, the gates stand wide open and look like they have not been closed
in a very long time. In a way, this is actually a more ominous sign than if
the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been
carved into the scorched stone walls surrounding the gates: Dargaard Keep.

A Scorched Courtyard
    This spacious courtyard is so vast that anyone foolish enough to invade
would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn
across the courtyard, lying near the freshly slain corpses of a battalion
of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.

A Scorched Courtyard

be unusually cold. The scorched stone arches overhead, creating a narrow
passage to the north which any attackers would be forced to funnel through,
creating an ideal place for slaughter. The maimed corpses and severed limbs
of recently slain knights lie scattered around the courtyard, but no crows
have dared to fly close enough to feast upon the rotting chunks of flesh.

house, opposite a stand of bunk beds. The guards who protect the main doors

The Great Doors of Dargaard Keep
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

over from the ancient fire that consumed the keep centuries ago. The heavy

The Great Hall of Dargaard Keep
    Here in the southeast corner of Dargaard Keep, a series of burnt velvet
couches sits against the crumbling walls. This must be where courtiers used
to lounge while waiting for an audience with the lord, and some tarnished
silver goblets lie on the ground where they were dropped as the attendants
tried to flee the fire that consumed the ancient keep. The enormous ceiling
swoops up high overhead, creating an ominous and oppressive atmosphere.

sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at

The Great Hall of Dargaard Keep
    Here in the southwest corner of Dargaard Keep, a row of scorched marble
busts runs along the blackened stone walls. All of the figures depicted by
the ancient busts are similar in appearance, so they must be from the same
bloodline. Despite having endured the fire that consumed the haunted keep,
all of the ancient busts are in relatively good shape. The enormous ceiling
swoops up high overhead, creating an ominous and oppressive atmosphere.

    The stale air of the magnificent entry hall of Dargaard Keep makes it

sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

couches sits against the crumbling walls. This must be where courtiers used
to lounge while waiting for an audience with the lord, and some tarnished

tried to flee the fire that consumed the ancient keep. The enormous ceiling

have been acquired over the centuries. Some of the shields are adorned with

    An ominous staircase begins at the southern end of this area, its broad
steps slowly ascending along the curve of the scorched stone wall. A black
marble railing keeps people from falling off the staircase, and most of the

staircase rises up, its wide steps slowly fade into the darkness above.

    A massive iron chandelier lies in a mangled heap in the center of the
great hall. Somehow, the twisted metal still glows with terrible heat, left
over from the ancient fire that consumed the keep centuries ago. The heavy
chandelier shredded the scorched purple rug it fell upon. The charred stone
underneath the rug shattered when the chandelier struck, creating a small
crater. Blackened columns march from south to north along both sides of the
tattered rug, like solemn stone sentinels eternally standing guard.

Before a Throne of Black Roses
    The faded opulence of this ancient keep is most obvious here before the
massive throne from which the lord renders judgment. Ruined tapestries of
black velvet hang upon the wall behind the round dais the foreboding throne
sits upon. A scorched rug of crushed purple velvet leads in from the south
and climbs the dais steps to the foot of the enormous black throne. A broad
swatch of black cloth embroidered with roses lies draped across the seat.

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

A Mountainous Path
    The rocky path comes to an abrupt end here since an avalanche of giant
black stones blocks any progress to the east. However, an enormous arched
bridge of scorched stone juts out from the path, spanning the great chasm
to the north where a foreboding black castle sits perched upon a bleak spur
of rock. The only choices here are to continue across the bridge or to turn
around and go home. Somehow, the second option seems like the smarter one.

A Scorched Stone Bridge
    Out here, high above the expansive chasm below, the chilling winds that
tear through the Dargaard Mountains cut to the bone. There are no railings
on either side, so the only safe route is to stay in the very center of the
bridge. While the stones near the southern side of the chasm are relatively
grey and nondescript, those closer to the foreboding castle on the northern
side appear to have been blackened by an intense and merciless fire.

The Imposing Gates of Dargaard Keep
    The arched stone bridge ends at an imposing set of iron gates. For some
reason, the gates stand wide open and look like they have not been closed
in a very long time. In a way, this is actually a more ominous sign than if
the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been
carved into the scorched stone walls surrounding the gates: Dargaard Keep.

would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn

of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
Someone has peeled a strip of green flesh off some unwilling goblin.

The Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

The Center of the Sahuagin Settlement
    At the intersection of the wide coral tunnels lays the center of the
sahuagin settlement. This chamber is quite large, tantamount to the great
square of Kalaman, only underwater. A large statue of an striking shark
stands at the center of the chamber, its vicious jaws open wide and ready
to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement
extends in all directions except for north, where the coral tunnels ends
abruptly at an underwater cliff.

A Strange Coral Tunnel
    At first glance, this coral tunnel appears to be quite normal. There
isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Before a Large Town
    Just off the main roadway to the east, the wretched bustling town of
Jelek sprawls out in its disgusting filth. The tents of slavers can be seen
cresting over the low protective wall that encircles the town. Nestled
close to the black beast of the Khalkists, the town looks truly fitting in
such a dark place. The road leads off to the north, leading through the
badlands. The mountains rise high above eastwards.

Skirting the Walls of Jelek
    The vast mercantile district of Jelek can be heard over the walls to
the east. The shouts of slavers and mercenaries give testament to the cruel
control that the Blue Dragonarmy has exerted over the crumbling city. The
road reaches a path to the north gates just to your north, continuing
towards the peaks of the Khalkists. Out to the west, the foothills cover
the badlands, leaving no sign of habitation in their midst.

Skirting the Walls of Jelek
    The decaying city of Jelek, just over the walls to the east, is filled
with the cries of slavers and mercenaries moving their slaves about. The
citizenry quickly hurries past, careful to avoid the gaze of the dragonarmy
and the slavers. The buildings are made of roughly hewn stone and clay,
hardly any timber can be seen on the buildings.

    The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself winds
off into the mountains to the east, disappearing among the rocky barren

sharper than a knife could cut. Far below birds are visible, circling to
find anything stupid enough to be blown off the mountain. The road travels

A Cobbled Path
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off

killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

The Emperor's Court
    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of

this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to

as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while

guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads

Approaching the Hills of Khuri-Khan
    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

Inside a Large Tent
     The tent, constructed of animal hides stretched over branches, is
pretty large. A large firepit lies in the centre, and the top has a
removable section of hide for inclement weather. The scent of roasted meat
inside the tent is overpowering, making you yet even hungrier. A large
chest, inlaid with gold lies a few feet away, filling your mind with
curiosity.

A Small Clearing
     You have walked into a small clearing. Long, flowing flaxen grass
sways gently in the wind, looking like waves on the ocean. A large, flat
rock lies in the middle of the room, heated by the rays of the sun and
cooled by the gentle breeze. To the east you see a hastily constructed
tent, made of hide, and to the west lies more expanse of the forest.

giving them a faint tinge. Off into the southern distance, you see a rustle
in the treetops and hear the whiz of an arrow, striking the tree adjacent
to you.

    The path suddenly stops, and two large trees bar your way south. The
forest grows considerably thicker here compared to the rest of the forest,
almost as if forming city walls. The trees also appear to be carefully
molded and shaped by a force much more intelligent and much less chaotic
than nature. Unable to see anything past the trees blocking your path
southward, humility washes over you. Whomever made it probably didn't want
to be disturbed.

     The tall oaks of the town known as Sorinthalas, carefully shaped by
centuries of delicate elven hands, reach skyward, clawing at the heavens
themselves. Small patches of flowers line the road, with an occasional fern
or two, spicing up the forested landscape. A small patch of fluorescent
green moss grows on the side of an ancient tree, forming letters. The

Top of the Temple of Branchala

reminds you of the types of homes abundant in Solace, with a hearty

warmth and understanding. The floor appears to be slightly grooved from

silken fineries and artistic works, sent to the king for his approval. Also
present are many baskets of food and sweets. From what you are able to
deduce, the king is either widowed or the children are inherited, as there
are no female belongings in the room. Laid out on the bed are many silken
robes and clothes. The bed itself is in fine shape, with bedposts and head
rest made of carved oak. The only exit lies to the west.

An Isolated Path
     The soothing chirps of birds and the clatter of chipmunks greets you
as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft
Hills Valley. Off into the distance, small woodland creatures playfully
leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent
stream twists and turns through the bottom of the small valley, beckoning
you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally
breaking the dense forest canopy. The pleasant scent of the forest wafts in
with a gentle breeze, harshly contrasting with the arid desert of the

The Chamber of Spring
    This room is a pleasant temperature, not too hot or too cold. While the
last chamber held an aura of death, this one almost seems to radiate life.
Well lit by some unseen source, the walls of this room are covered by
creeping vines, and flowered ivy. The only exits seem to be a hole in the
floor, and one in the ceiling which is blocked by a large bronze plate.

The Plane of the Gods
    You have arrived at the heavenly home of the ancient gods of Lemuria.
They stand before you, wispy ghosts of their former selves. Their tragedy
is just as great as that of the Lemurians, for in destroying the city in
their fit of vengence, they slew all of their worshippers, thus cutting off
their ultimate source of power. And now they stand before you, looking at
you quietly; sad, but proud to the end. Jagged bolts of lightning cross the
dark sky as the chill winds whip around you. A faintly glowing portal on
the ground seems to be the only way back.
The spirit of an ancient sahuagin warleader floats here.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

An Underwater Cave
    The stone walls of the cavern have been gashed by heavy claws and
snapping teeth. This would indicate that some ferocious beast regularly
visits this location. The water here is uncharacteristically warm, much
warmer than anywhere else in the New Sea. While this could potentially be
the result of geothermal vents at the bottom of the cavern, it is more
likely caused by the presence of whatever beast lives here. Rotting corpses
can be seen floating in the water near the top of the cavern.

Inside a Coral Cavern
    This cavern is different from the rest of the coral tunnel. The walls
of the cavern are incredibly smooth, with no jagged edges or protruding
columns of dead coral. Seeing as there is no wave action this deep it is
odd how this came to be. The floor of the cave is sandy, silty and is home
to several species of sea grasses. An opening at the top of the cavern
allows light to filter through when the sun is up, while the western part
of the cavern lies in perpetual darkness.

book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a

Around the Sandbar
    The mound of sand rises above the surface of the water to the east. A
small palm tree growing on the sandbar flickers in and out of view as the
changing water plays with the light. There are scarcely any fish here. The
few that remain are thin, bony and have difficulty swimming. An expanse of
sandy underwater desert lies to the north. It gradually descends into the
murkier water below. Silhouettes of anchor lines can be seen to the south.

Along the Sandy Bottom
    The sea floor begins to steepen its descent to the travel north. Subtle
waves of sand, probably created by the tide, line the sandy bottom in a
southerly direction. Just as below the harbor, thin and sickly fish swim by
slowly hanging on to life. Fish bones are scattered along the sea floor,
giving testament to the fishermen's complaints. The sandy expanse continues
to the north as far as the eye can see.

At the Edge of a Rocky Shelf
    The underwater desert comes to a hasty halt as you find yourself at the
edge of a sandy shelf. Up ahead, a cliff falls over seventy feet to another
clearly visible shelf. An enormous coral reef sits upon the shelf below and
extends to the north, west and east. The sand here has been cleared from the
shelf making it look like a hastily prepared staging area.

Within a Natural Coral Tunnel
    This tunnel is a natural phenomena in the coral reef that predates even
the great Cataclysm. It took hundreds of years for the coral-consuming
creatures of the reef to create. Every wall of the tunnel is a reminder of
the many species of coral that once lived here. Now all that remains are
several sea stars which form a semi-circle from the bottom of the western
wall to the bottom of the eastern wall. The tunnel continues down through
an opening in the coral while the cliff top lies above.

isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating

mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without

the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

A Scorched Courtyard
    This spacious courtyard is so vast that anyone foolish enough to invade
would have to run through a hail of archer fire, assuming the battlements
are being manned. Broken heaps of ancient, half-melted weapons lies strewn
across the courtyard, lying near the freshly slain corpses of a battalion
of Solamnic knights. The crumbling stones here were burned centuries ago by
a horrendous fire, and the western section of the courtyard has broken off
and fallen into the yawning chasm far below the ancient keep.

The Great Doors of Dargaard Keep
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

house, opposite a stand of bunk beds. The guards who protect the main doors
of the burnt-out keep would normally rest here, but since the undead have
no need to sleep, the bunks have lain unused for hundreds of years. A round

of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

difficult to breathe here. Massive columns of blackened stone stand on both
sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

    A massive iron chandelier lies in a mangled heap in the center of the

over from the ancient fire that consumed the keep centuries ago. The heavy

underneath the rug shattered when the chandelier struck, creating a small
crater. Blackened columns march from south to north along both sides of the
tattered rug, like solemn stone sentinels eternally standing guard.

The Great Hall of Dargaard Keep
    The broken shields of fallen warriors hang on the wall, trophies that
have been acquired over the centuries. Some of the shields are adorned with
modern designs, but most of them are decorated with old devices that have
not been used in a long time. An assortment of broken weapons lie among the
charred tapestries lying on the floor in haphazard piles near the eastern
wall. The enormous ceiling swoops up until it is lost in darkness.

defenders of Dargaard Keep, and some of the armaments still lean up against
the walls. A burning furnace stands near the back of the armoury, and the
large anvil next to it has seen recent use. The rank smell of ancient death
permeates the room, and the air feels unnaturally dense in here. The sturdy

The Second Floor Walkway
    A wide walkway of scorched black stone marches around the perimeter of
the keep, high above the grand hall far below. A series of slender arrow
slits perforate the outer wall at regular intervals so archers can fire at
invaders in the courtyard with impunity. A railing of finely carved marble
prevents people from accidentally falling off the edge of the walkway. The
sturdy iron door set into the wall to the west looks nigh impregnable.

A Scorched Barracks Room
    This large chamber is filled with bunk beds arranged in a six-by-six
grid pattern. Some of the wooden bunks have fallen apart, but most of them
still look strong enough to support a grown man. The chests that were once
used to store personal belongings have all been smashed open and looted. A
heavy oaken door at the north end of the chamber leads to a separate room,
while the opposing door at the south end has been smashed by the collapse
of the passage behind it. A short hallway leads off to the east.

The Officers' Quarters
    A series of simple wooden beds stand against the scorched stone walls,
and a wooden trunk resting at the foot of each bed. A square table of oak
surrounded by short stools sits in the center of this spartan chamber. The
chamber is clearly where officers of middle rank would be housed, though
clearly, no one has slept in here for centuries. A heavy oaken door stands
between these officers' quarters and the general barracks to the south.

A Scorched Barracks Room
    This large chamber is filled with bunk beds arranged in a six-by-six
grid pattern. Some of the wooden bunks have fallen apart, but most of them
still look strong enough to support a grown man. The chests that were once
used to store personal belongings have all been smashed open and looted. A
heavy oaken door at the north end of the chamber leads to a separate room,
while the opposing door at the south end has been smashed by the collapse
of the passage behind it. A short hallway leads off to the east.

east to west between two barracks rooms where the defenders of the ancient
keep used to be housed. A row of empty iron sconces line the southern wall,
opposite the statue of a gallant knight carved out of the northern one. The
statue appears to have survived the fire that consumed the keep with little
damage, and the knight it depicts is looking upwards as if in prayer.

though there is still enough room for three people to stand abreast. A row
of empty iron sconces line the western wall, opposite a curving stairway
that leads up into the darkness. The heavy wooden door to the north stands
strong despite having been through a terrible fire, and the simple archway
to the south leads back to the main hall of the ruined stone keep.

of charred stone leads to the south. A series of arrow slits perforate the

A Narrow Stone Bridge
    This narrow bridge of scorched stone connects the ominous central keep
with the surrounding ramparts. The blackened stones are still in relatively
good shape, though the statuettes carved into the railings were ruined when
the castle was consumed with fire. Some unusual star-shaped scorch patterns
have recently been burned onto the stones, and they resemble the marks left
by lightning strikes. An imposing iron door stands between the bridge and
the giant black keep looming overhead. The bridge arches over an encampment
of blue tents which have been erected in the ruined courtyard below.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Sea. Kalaman is located upstream of the Vingaard River. The view of the

A Path Between the Sea and Cliffs
    There is little room to walk and maneuver on this small beach path
between the vast ocean to the north and the tall cliffs to the south.
Despite its size, the path is well-traveled by local fisherman who bring
their daily catch to markets in Vogler and Kalaman. Conspicuous shards of
broken coral lay scattered on the beach and path. The rocky path continues
to the east while a boat waits for fisherman to ferry them to Kalaman.

progress to the east. Numerous crustaceans crawl around in shallow pools
of water here, foraging for food while they wait for the tide to arrive.
A gap in the cliffs to the north leads to a calm harbor where fishing
boats can safely drop anchor. Beyond that, a sandbar rises out of the
expansive ocean. The Vingaard Estuary can barely be made out to the west
while to the south, cliffs form the edge of the path.

A Calm Harbor
    Everything is calm here. The clear blue water beneath your feet is
mostly still with the occasional wind driven wave passing through. A soft
breeze blows through here and there, but nothing like the fierce winds of
the sea ahead. Several boats, belonging to local fishermen are moored here,
rocking in the wind. A small sandbar rises out of the water to north while
waves gently lap against the tall cliffs to the south.

    Shimmering hues of blue, green, and a peculiar gold, stream down from

the boats above from drifting away, dot the sandy bottom beneath the calm
harbor. Several sunken boats sit eerily on the harbor floor never again to
sail the seas. Farther to the north, sand and seashells have been gathered
by incoming waves, creating a mound rising slightly above the surface.

small palm tree growing on the sandbar flickers in and out of view as the
changing water plays with the light. There are scarcely any fish here. The
few that remain are thin, bony and have difficulty swimming. An expanse of
sandy underwater desert lies to the north. It gradually descends into the
murkier water below. Silhouettes of anchor lines can be seen to the south.

giving testament to the fishermen's complaints. The sandy expanse continues

    This tunnel is a natural phenomena in the coral reef that predates even
the great Cataclysm. It took hundreds of years for the coral-consuming
creatures of the reef to create. Every wall of the tunnel is a reminder of

several sea stars which form a semi-circle from the bottom of the western
wall to the bottom of the eastern wall. The tunnel continues down through

isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without
falling after passing through the barrier holding the water up.

there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.

walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are

An Ornate Hallway
    The hallway through the southern section of the temple is lined with an
assortment of very ornate decorations, though they are displayed in a most
grisly fashion. The severed arms of many different races are affixed to the
eastern wall, holding all sorts of sceptres and weapons. Meanwhile, a wide
variety of religious symbols hang from the disembodied heads mounted on the
western wall. The flesh has rotted off most of the wall fixtures, leaving
only skeletal hands and heads to support these trophies. The center of the
temple lies back to the north, while the source of the milky white water
appears to lie to the south of here.

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

An Intersection in the Temple

obscures one's vision. The crude stones give way to porous white coral to
up above and in the tunnel to the north. There, the gloom seems to clear as
clean water gently flows in through the tiny holes in the coral. West from
here, the faint outline of some gigantic sea creature is barely visible
through a strange bubble-like barrier. A faintly lit chamber lies off to

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
A potion is lying here.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

THE VILLAGE OF RIGITT
=====================

BACKGROUND:

The town of Rigitt is a small but prosperous fishing village under the
extended rule of Tarsis. The seasonal fishing in Ice Mountain Bay has been
plentiful for several years, leading to rapid development of Rigitt and
its bustling marina.

The new-found wealth in the area has drawn the interest of many merchants
who have built profitable shops and stalls around the village. Hundreds of
fishermen visit the bay's waters to cast their fishing lines and sell their
catch in the town's local fish market.

The marina of Rigitt is frequented by trade ships from all over Ansalon,
keeping the bustling deckhands occupied throughout the day. Ferries along
the southern docks of the village provide transportation to several other
coastal towns around Ansalon.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The town of Rigitt is safe for all to explore, assuming the drunken sailors
don't try to pick a fight. Mid-high level adventurers [16-25] may find
suitable challenges and rare goods around the area.

LOCATION:

The Village of Rigitt has been established along the northeast coast of Ice
Mountain Bay, immediately to the south of Tarsis and a short distance west
of Zeeriak.

TIRABOT MANOR
=============

BACKGROUND:

Tirabot Keep was established by the Solamnic Knighthood 400 years after
the Third Dragon War, when the Kingpriests began to become corrupted
with their vile intrigues. The keep was close enough to Istar while
remaining safe within the borders of ancient Solamnia.

During the Cataclysm, the keep and much of the surrounding area was
destroyed by earthquakes and wildfires. The Keep became abandoned by
the Knighthood and basically forgotten.

The land was reclaimed during the beginning of the War of the Lance.
Its primary use was a stopover point for the knights and Solamnic
armies going from Palanthas to Kalaman. It now serves as an outpost on
the plains to keep an eye out for threats from draconians and the Dark
Knights of Takhisis.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The village of the keep offers safe exploration for all levels. For
those who wish to storm the keep, however, it would be advised to take
a well-rounded group of more experienced adventurers [18-24].

LOCATION:

Tirabot Keep is positioned as a final stopover point for the knights
travelling from Palanthas to Kalaman. It is set in-between the borders
of the plains of Solamnia and the foothills of the Khalkist Mountains.

A Path Between the Sea and Cliffs
    There is little room to walk and maneuver on this small beach path
between the vast ocean to the north and the tall cliffs to the south.
Despite its size, the path is well-traveled by local fisherman who bring
their daily catch to markets in Vogler and Kalaman. Conspicuous shards of
broken coral lay scattered on the beach and path. The rocky path continues
to the east while a boat waits for fisherman to ferry them to Kalaman.

A gap in the cliffs to the north leads to a calm harbor where fishing
boats can safely drop anchor. Beyond that, a sandbar rises out of the
expansive ocean. The Vingaard Estuary can barely be made out to the west
while to the south, cliffs form the edge of the path.

rocking in the wind. A small sandbar rises out of the water to north while
waves gently lap against the tall cliffs to the south.

the great Cataclysm. It took hundreds of years for the coral-consuming
creatures of the reef to create. Every wall of the tunnel is a reminder of
the many species of coral that once lived here. Now all that remains are
several sea stars which form a semi-circle from the bottom of the western
wall to the bottom of the eastern wall. The tunnel continues down through
an opening in the coral while the cliff top lies above.

isn't anything particularly strange about the coral walls themselves, and
the base of the statue above seems quite normal. What is odd, however, is
that the water filling the tunnel seems to stop abruptly at an invisible
barrier separating it from a large chamber below. Through the undulating
surface of the water, a large statue is visible. It is unclear why the
water here doesn't crash down into the chamber below, though the bigger
mystery is whether one might be able to reach the floor below without

The Center of the Sahuagin Temple
    The central intersection of the temple is filled with moist air. While
there is a thin layer of water covering the stone floor, one is able to
move and breathe regularly. Four tunnels lead away from the intersection,
and each one is most definitely flooded with water. An unknown magic holds
the water from the tunnels at bay, turning this chamber into a sort of
bubble and preventing the surrounding water from flooding in. Faint sounds
float into the chamber, reverberating strangely off the hanging water. It
sounds like there is a heated discussion down the eastern tunnel, while
shrieks of agony come from the western tunnel. From the south can be heard
the sonorous chanting of a deep female voice. Against the northern wall,
a gigantic statue of crudely carved stone looms over the chamber.

The High Priestess' Prayer Room
    The worship room of the sahuagin high priesthood is considered to be
the most sacred of places in sahuagin society. Little sahuagin children are
taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if
their immediate existence depended on it, which it often did. The room's
furnishings are minimal but the few pieces of furniture here exude the
unmistakable aura of prayer and sacrifice. The southern wall is dominated
by a massive coral altar shaped to resemble the jaws of an enormous shark.
Flanking the jaws are two wide coral bowls. A milky white substance gushes
out of the bowls, filling the room with an intoxicating taste. The coral
walls are completely devoid of any permanent decorations, though they are
currently covered with hundreds of sinuous runes smeared in blood.

taught from an early age to fear this room and respect its importance as if

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands

A Junction of Paths
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square
    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.

The Alchemy Lab of Dawnguard
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

Before the City of Neraka
    The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film

    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
