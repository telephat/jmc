Spell    : Dark Blessing
Sphere   : Protection
Usage    : cast 'dark blessing' target
Duration : varies
Effects  : Bestows Takhisis' blessing upon the target.

target. This will free the target of several negative influences and
allow them to better survive upcoming attacks for a few combat
rounds.

The Dark Queen grants her blessing to those willing to further her
cause, and will frown upon those naive enough to attempt to use this
spell to aid her opponents.

Details:
- Utility spell which grants bonuses to LIMIT_DAMAGE_FACTOR,
  CONCENTRATION_FACTOR, and RESIST_MAGIC to the target.
- Will also remove most negative spell effects from the target.
- Casting this spell on good-aligned targets may have unwanted effects.

Spell    : Dark Blessing
Sphere   : Protection
Usage    : cast 'dark blessing' target
Duration : varies
Effects  : Bestows Takhisis' blessing upon the target.

With this spell the caster bestows the blessing of Takhisis upon the 
target. This will free the target of several negative influences and
allow them to better survive upcoming attacks for a few combat
rounds.

The Dark Queen grants her blessing to those willing to further her
cause, and will frown upon those naive enough to attempt to use this
spell to aid her opponents.

Details:
- Utility spell which grants bonuses to LIMIT_DAMAGE_FACTOR,
  CONCENTRATION_FACTOR, and RESIST_MAGIC to the target.
- Will also remove most negative spell effects from the target.
- Casting this spell on good-aligned targets may have unwanted effects.
