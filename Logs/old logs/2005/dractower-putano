The steel chains clink together in a pile as your drop them on the floor.
Reverantly, you lift the cover of the book, careful not to rip any of the
time worn pages. Confidently, you examine each page with an uncanny
thoroughness. Even though the runes are nearly impossible to make out, their
meaning comes easily to you. Withdrawing your spellbook, you expertly write
the spell, 'relocate' on a few blank pages.
As the book is used, the old wardings on the front cover begin to glow
softly. Suddenly, the flawless chain dissolves into nothingness. With the
disappearance of the chain, the book begins to crumble away, a process long
overdue.

The steel chains clink together in a pile as your drop them on the floor.
Reverantly, you lift the cover of the book, careful not to rip any of the
time worn pages. Confidently, you examine each page with an uncanny
thoroughness. Even though the runes are nearly impossible to make out, their
meaning comes easily to you. Withdrawing your spellbook, you expertly write
the spell, 'relocate' on a few blank pages.
As the book is used, the old wardings on the front cover begin to glow
softly. Suddenly, the flawless chain dissolves into nothingness. With the
disappearance of the chain, the book begins to crumble away, a process long
overdue.
