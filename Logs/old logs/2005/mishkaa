angelic in nature, the look of anger and resentment on her face is
anything but angelic. Her skin is fair and pure, her eyes sparkling blue,
but it is dimmed by the anger in her posture. She remains on the edge
of the witches' circle, constantly looking at her sisters and then out
at the swamp around them. There is little doubt she would rather be
anywhere but the Illyoc Swamp.

the strong sense of druidic magic that swirls and dances around her.

   Format: Commune

Through the use of this skill, the practitioner is able to become closer
with the natural surroundings around themselves. Users of this skill
say that by feeling more at one with nature they are able to speed up the
healing processes of the body and become more aware of nighttime sounds
that others might sleep through.  Highly skilled druids even say that
they find themselves better able to focus their mind upon remembering
past spells.

Practitioners of this skill will find it difficult if not impossible to
exercise it around man-made structures.
