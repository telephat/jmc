Spell: Righteous Indignation
Sphere: Combat
Usage: cast 'Righteous Indignation'
Duration: (level * 4) hours
Effects: Temporarily stops changes to faith, at a cost

This spell allows the caster to beseech his deity and request permission to
temporarily strike down his enemies, regardless of how pure their actions
have been in the past.

Please note that this ability is not granted lightly by the gods, and its
useage will place a strain on the caster's relationship with his deity,
both upon the casting of the spell, and for many days afterwards while the
caster proves that his devotion remains true.
