A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if

A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

very erratic and seem to shift before your eyes. The third word is etched
deep into the bone, yet the runes appear weathered and smooth. The last
word was clearly made with a sharp knife. Together, the runes read:

Thick red clay has been carefully sculpted into a small, cylindrical jar.
A series of crude etchings around the outside of the jar depict spectral
figures locked hand-in-hand as they encircle whatever must be inside. The
jar looks incredibly heavy, yet it hangs suspended in mid-air. It would
be easy enough to just open it by lifting the simple circular lid.

A Twisting Corridor of Jagged Stone
    Jagged shards of stone line this dark, twisting corridor. The tips of
the stones have been worn smooth by thousands of shuffling footsteps. The
air is stale and dry, as if it has been trapped down here for centuries.
The unnatural corridor seems to be rotating slowly, and occasionally it
jerks abruptly, making it difficult to stay standing. It is impossible to
see far enough down the corridor in either direction to know where, if
anywhere, it might lead to.

The General Store of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames flicker in the small sconces hanging on the oaken
walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames cast lively shadows which
dance upon the solid wooden stall parked squarely in the middle of the area.
From time to time, adventurers saunter near the make-shift shop and pause for
good-natured haggling with the seasoned proprietor. The atmosphere in the
room excites the spirit, turning one's thoughts to sight-seeing, world
traveling, and (of course) the supplies necessary to do so.
A grinning and grey-haired man invites potential shoppers to his stall.

Trapped in a Shimmering Sphere
    Shimmering liquid metal curves around you to form a rippling sphere
of chrome that emits a strange unlight. The sphere's highly reflective
interior surface shines as if it had been polished to a mirror finish.
The sphere is small enough that one could easily reach out a hand to
touch its undulating surface, but the reflective surfaces facing each
other make the world appear to be a distorted, mind-bending infinity.

touch sphere
As you touch the surface of the undulating sphere, the strange liquid
metal suddenly evaporates into a silver mist and vanishes. Waves of
psycho-kinetic energy wash over you, and you cover your eyes in an
attempt to protect them from harm.
Your eyes burn for a moment and then feel normal again.
The blessing of the ancients subsides.
You feel less threatening.
The force guiding your weapon leaves you.
Your shroud fades away.
The glow of your skin slowly fades.
You feel less protected from undeath.
The darkness in your soul breaks.

When you regain your senses, you find yourself floating among strange,
psychedelic lights that seem oddly familiar.
Caught in a Spectral Storm
    Psycho-kinetic energy surges erratically around this strange place,
seeming to simultaneously flow in all directions and none. Psychedelic
lights shimmer just beyond sight, like a splinter of the mind. The air,
if it can be called that, has a slimy quality to it. It is impossible to
tell up from down here, or even to be sure who you are. It seems like it
would be easy to move in any direction, though that likely won't get you
very far. There is something eerily familiar about this strange place.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
The clan alchemist is standing here.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
A magical ward protects the stronghold.
A clan fountain is here.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
A wooden sign has been nailed to a tree here.

Outside the Southern Gates of Kalaman
    You are outside the gates of the city of Kalaman. The large stone walls
rise high above you. From this vantage point you are able to see a few
Solamnic Knights walking about along the battlements. The huge city gates
are directly north of you and a path skirts the city to the west. There is
also a long road extending to the south through the plains.
