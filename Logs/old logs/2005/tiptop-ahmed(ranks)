    No one seems to have noticed you slip in, but you are careful to avoid
the gaze of the other soldiers. The troop consists mostly of humans, with
a few draconians and hobgoblins scattered in each line. Not some of the
cleanliest individuals from the smell of it. They have more the shifty look
of bandits and cutthroats than battle-seasoned warriors. Most are probably
new recruits, though from the looks of a few soldiers not everyone
volunteered. You hear a few curses and mutters as the soldiers get back
into formation. A sharp glance from the drill sergeant quickly silences
most of the talk.

     Whoever made the sign hanging on the northern wall of this gruesome
chamber had a black sense of humor. Flanked by two moss-covered yellowing
skulls, a rotten wood sign proclaims this room to be the "Faith Instruction
School." The method of instruction taught here, however, seems to be of the
painful sort, as every torture device imaginable lines the walls. Racks and
iron maidens caked with dried blood loom menacingly from the corners, and
manacles fill in the empty spaces on the walls.

The hungry-looking kender searches the room, oblivious to your presence.
Suddenly he stops and rummages through a pocket, pulling out a loaf of stale
bread.  Wolfing it down, he looks at Klu as he licks his fingers.

"Mmmmmm, that's more like it!" he says.  "You know they haven't fed me since
yesterday!  I'm still hungry though, so I think I'll go back to the kitchen and
see if they have any more of those tasty pies or chickens.  I bet the kitchen
staff will be happy to see me, they seemed really excited to find me in the
pantries yesterday!"  The kender pulls an ornate gold fork with the Temple of
the Gods emblem on it from a pocket, stares at it then re-pockets it.

Looking at the sign on the wall, the kender pushes in on the left skull,
causing a secret door in the wall to open.  As he ambles through it it closes,
and his happy voice fades out.
