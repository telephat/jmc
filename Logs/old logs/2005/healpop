286H 113V 7115605X 217C > l roomCourt of the Aghar
    This is the throne room created for the Highbulp of the gully dwarves
who reside in Xak Tsaroth. Large swaths of garish golden and silver cloth
have been draped throughout the room, wrapped haphazardly around and
between columns, creating a mind-boggling array of shimmering decor. Hung
over the excessive amounts of metallic cloth are a large number of ancient
tapestries that were once probably quite beautiful but have since been
'improved' upon by the gully dwarves with brightly colored paint, creating
an even more confusing and blinding display of interior design. As though
that itself were not enough, a number of graceful nude statues adorn the
room, also 'improved' by the gully dwarves with an almost disturbing amount
of realism and detail. At the head of the room sits a large ornamental
throne decorated with the finest objects of an even remotely shiny fashion
that could be found.

286H 113V 7115605X 217C > l bupuThis small female gully dwarf sits comfortably upon the throne here in the
Court of Aghar. Her thick bulbous nose and dirty cheecks frame a pair of
sharply colored eyes that are the first hint that this is not an ordinary
gully dwarf. Wearing a red dress that has been torn nearly in half to fit
her, and has been patched more times than is worth counting, each time with
a different color and type of cloth. She looks as though she'd like to
explain something to you. Though someone might need to explain it to her,
first.
Bupu is in an excellent condition.

    A potion of knowledge has been added to the magic shop (or shop selling
recalls) in most of the starting towns across the continent. This potion
will work exactly like a scroll of legend lore, except it is a potion and
can only be used on the character quaffing it. These potions sell in the
50-70 coin range and are provided to allow easier and cheaper access to
your character's stats.

    With the new lore level we thought this might be helpful.

Enjoy,

-Lore level lowered to level 3.
-Other neat stuff.

223H 71V 356190X 242C Exits:NSW> he spe di evilSpell    : Dispel Evil
Sphere   : Protection
Usage    : cast 'dispel evil' [opponent]
Duration : Instantaneous
Damage   : Massive to Serious damage

Casting this spell will attempt to dispel evil creatures. Evil creatures of
level equal or lower to the caster will suffer massive damage. Creatures of
higher level will suffer serious damage.

Good creatures may not be dispelled - Paladine himself will often intervene.
Attempting to dispel an evil victim is not wise if the caster is of more
evil alignment, since effectively the caster will dispel the more evil
combatant, himself!

223H 45V 356190X 242C Exits:E> Spell    : Dispel Evil
Sphere   : Protection
Usage    : cast 'dispel evil' [opponent]
Duration : Instantaneous
Damage   : Massive to Serious damage

Casting this spell will attempt to dispel evil creatures. Evil creatures of
level equal or lower to the caster will suffer massive damage. Creatures of
higher level will suffer serious damage.

Good creatures may not be dispelled - Paladine himself will often intervene.
Attempting to dispel an evil victim is not wise if the caster is of more
evil alignment, since effectively the caster will dispel the more evil
combatant, himself!

223H 72V 356190X 242C Exits:NSW> help alignmentThe Alignment System:

There are 10 different alignments at arctic. These alignments can be
arranged so as to form a circle of alignments. The names of some of the
alignments are very much like some of the D&D alignments. Make no
assumptions about what an alignment is based on its D&D counterpart. The
alignments can be grouped by good/neutral/evil or by
lawful/chaotic/neither(neutral). The word neutral, however, will always be
used in the context of the former grouping. The former grouping also takes
precedence over the second grouping. The good alignments are those
characters that fight for the cause of good against evil. Such characters
do not take a life lightly| they will bear the consequences of their
actions. The evil alignments indicate those who have taken up the fight
against good, and seek to destroy it. Neutral characters seek a balance of
the forces of good and evil, and so try to be balanced in their actions.
Lawful essentially means an extreme. Thus Good Lawful is an alignment which
is good in the extreme. The idea here is that the truly good, neutral, or
evil will work within the confines of their respective rule systems to
further their ultimate goal. The most evil, for example, will not kill
indiscriminately, as they will not kill those who can be useful to them (in
game terms this basically means other evil creatures) in the interests of
the struggle versus good.

 [return for more, q to stop]
Alignments affect a number of things in the game.  Some objects will or will
not be usable by certain groups.  Alignment determines the colour of a mage's
robe, and the moon with which their power fluctuates.  The experience
received from mobiles is dependent on the alignments of the combatants that
are involved.  Keep a close watch of the experience you are getting, this
will give you an idea of whether such behaviour is appropriate for somebody
of your alignment.  The good alignments are penalized the most for killing
inappropriately, and are rewarded the most for taking up their fight against
evil.  The neutral alignments will get full experience for almost any mobile
but must maintain a balance to remain neutral.  Evil alignments will get
full experience for everything but other evil mobs, but will be rewarded with
bonus experience when fighting for the cause of evil.

Here is a list of the 10 alignments:
    NC Neutral Chaotic          NL Neutral Lawful
    EC Evil Chaotic             NG Neutral Good
    EL Evil Lawful              GN Good Neutral
    EN Evil Neutral             GL Good Lawful
    NE Neutral Evil             GC Good Chaotic

You can get selected help on any of these.  For example, to get help on the

 [return for more, q to stop]neutral chaotic alignment, you can do "help nc" or "help neutral chaotic".

THE PATH OF ALIGNMENTS

        The following diagram shows how the alignments are related to one 
another. A '<' pointing at an alignment means you need to make a positive
change (destroy evil) to move in that direction. A '>' pointing at an
alignment means you need to make a negative change (destroy good) to move
in that direction.

        GL <-> GC <-> GN <-> NG <-> NL <-> NC <-> NE <-> EN <-> EL <-> EC

serve as both protector and healer using the spells bestowed upon them by
their deity.  Clerics are granted incredible powers over undead.

Clerics are valuable to a group not only for their healing arts but also as a
moderate fighter.  Although they are not trained in martial skills they are
sturdy folk and should not be underestimated.  Because clerics are reluctant
to shed blood, they may only use blunt or bludgeoning weapons.

The clerics primary abilities are wisdom and intelligence.

Early Skills:
bludgeons               miscellaneous           turn

NOTE: Later skills must be learned about through playing the class.

Allowable Races:
human     half-elf     wild elf     high elf     hylar     gnome
minotaur  kender       theiwar      hill dwarf

--------

The spell system on Arctic is a fairly simple one.  Here the mana
system, common to most Diku-style MUDs, has been abandoned for one which
closely resembles the D&D system:  players acquire their spells (into a
virtual spellbook) from guildmasters and/or spell/prayer books and use of
the spell requires the caster to first memorize it.  Spells are categorized
by class and divided into spell levels, usually indicating the power and/or
difficulty of the spell.  As the player goes up in levels, they will find
the lower level spells easier to cast and less likely to fail, especially
during combat.

Acquiring Spells
----------------

All spellcasters can obtain many or all of their low level spells from
guildmasters.  Guildmasters do not necessarily know all spells, and it
may be necessary to visit two or more of them before discovering a new
spell.  You can usually find a guildmaster in a major town, such as
Solace or Tarsis.  You should use the "learn" command at the
guildmaster of your guild to learn new spells.

    If not for the large dome overhead allowing in bits of sun, moon and
starlight this small holy circle would be bathed in complete darkness. The
slime-covered walls of this room almost entirely mask the presence of many
once beautiful frescoes that covered these walls in better times. The
near-lack of dust on the floor makes this section of the temple seem to be
one of the more thoroughly searched areas of Xak Tsaroth. A set of silver
doors leads north into the main chamber, nearer to the statue of Mishakal.

    Several rows of dusty marble benches line both sides of this small
worship room. At the front of the room, beyond the benches is a large dais
where many priests of Xak Tsaroth are rumored to have hidden ancient
treasures of the gods. To the east the main chamber is clearly visible,
bathed in a clean blue light from the statue of Mishakal.

been removed.
