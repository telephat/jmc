Morgoth's Trail
     These woods, named after their discoverer, Sir Morgoth, Solamnic
Knight of the Crown of Vingaard keep,  stretch out around you.  The forest
had at one time been one of the most beautiful places in northern Krynn.
Recently, however people have been disappearing from the forest in alarming
numbers.  A band of guards were recently dispatched to investigate these
disappearances.  This band did not return.  You are bewitched by the
beauty, but on guard because of the hidden dangers that lurk somewhere
within the woods.  The clearing can be seen to east and the path continues
deeper into Morgoth Wood to the south.

Grey Gates of Grak
     The grey path ends abruptly when it arrives at a large pair of grey
steel gates.  There are piles of bones at either side of the gate,
testimony to the danger that lies behind them.  A skull which appears to be
elven forms the knocker upon the gates.  There are no key holes evident nor
is there a handle upon the door.  There is a small sign upon the wall.

A Dark Entryway
     The ground beneath your feet reminds you of the hard packed dirt of a
cemetery.  Tall pillars flank a large gate to your west that leads out of
the worshiping quarter of the temple.  There is a small exit leading off to
the north and another larger exit to the east.

Entryway to Barracks
     Through a door to the south you see a dark grey gate.  Beds are
arranged in military fashion towards the north.  Few personal belongings
lie around the room.  The beds are all in good repair, though most are now
empty.  The barracks stretch far to the north and well as to the west.

Secret Tunnel of Grak
     You are in a bright tunnel.  Light pours into the white walled tunnel
from small holes in the ceiling.  Murals of dragons in the dragon wars
adorn the walls of the hallway.  The path leads to the east and back to the
barracks to the west.

crooked staff in his hand.

     A thorny door dominates the room.  The white tunnel blends into thorns
and there is no discernible difference between the two.  As you inspect the
thorns you see that there is a doorknob which would seem to turn easily.
The thorns seem to be similar to rose thorns as they intertwine to form a
barrier blocking the passage.

Grak's Bedroom
     You enter a room that is both large and opulent.  There is a floor of
polished marble inlaid with gold.  It stretches from wall to wall. The roof
of the room is a large dome depicting the night sky.  The three major
constellations of Takhisis, Gilean and Paladine can be seen, encrusted with
diamonds in the roof high above.  The walls are clean and white,
interrupted only with the faceless mask that is Morgion's symbol. In the
corner lies a huge bed with a solid steel frame.  A small door can be seen
to the north, and the entrance is visible back to the west.

Grak's Bedroom
     You enter a room that is both large and opulent.  There is a floor of
polished marble inlaid with gold.  It stretches from wall to wall. The roof
of the room is a large dome depicting the night sky.  The three major
constellations of Takhisis, Gilean and Paladine can be seen, encrusted with
diamonds in the roof high above.  The walls are clean and white,
interrupted only with the faceless mask that is Morgion's symbol. In the
corner lies a huge bed with a solid steel frame.  A small door can be seen
to the north, and the entrance is visible back to the west.

Torturer's Bedroom and Kitchen
     This appears to be the living quarters of the temple's head torturer.
It is quite luxurious.  Silken sheets adorn the bed and the table appears
to be made of silver.  The torturer seems to have interest in the finer
things in life.  You can see two small rooms leading off to the south and
east. These are continuations of his quarters.  A broken, empty bottle of
wine upon the floor appears to be from Silvanesti, testament to the long
reach that the cult has upon Krynn.
You see a sadistic looking gnoll leap up and attack you!

ARGAND KEEP
===========

BACKGROUND:

Sir Argand is the newest in a long line of Solamnic Knights from his
family.  Recently retired to be with his childhood sweetheart, now his
wife and to raise his child, he settled down in his family's keep, near
Tarsis.  A few months ago, at the request of his good friend Lord Calof
of Kalaman, he came out of retirement and led an elite force to break
up the power of the Temple of Grak on the outskirts of Kalaman.  The
mission was a success and they smashed the power for a while, and he
returned home to his family.  However, since then, no word has been
heard from him, even from the messenger sent by Lord Calof to check on
his friend.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The keep of Sir Argand should be relatively easy for adventurer's [7-12].
but it may take a more elite group [10-15] to finish the task at hand.

LOCATION:

Argand Keep lies to the northwest of Tarsis.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
The stronghold receptionist is here, showing clan members to their rooms.

furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the

room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

The Forge of Dawnguard
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The City Portal of Dawnguard
    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

The Inn of Dawnguard
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

The Entrance to the Halls of Dawnguard
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Road to Kalaman
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
