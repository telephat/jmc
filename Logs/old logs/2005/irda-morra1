/      |The Biggest Arctic Contest In The Last Decade|
/       =============================================
/ 
/     Thanks to the generous support of an anonymous donor, 
/   Arctic has recently obtained the rights to have a quick 
/   connect icon on zmud clients. The icon will be up for 1 
/   year. During this time an estimated 100,000+ downloads 
/   of the client are expected. We hope this leads new
/   players into our favorite fantasy home.
/
/     There is a huge problem. We do not have a good image 
/   for our icon. So that we can get the best icon, we are 
/   running a contest that involves you. You have until 
/   Feburary 27th, 12:00PM EST to submit designs for the 
/   icon. The selected icon will be displayed on our new 
/   webpage and on Zmud clients around the world. Rewards 
/   for the best icon will be substantial and permenant.
/
/                Specifications for the Icon
/                ---------------------------
/
/
/             2. The icon should hint or exude the 
/                relationship to Dragonlance.
/
/             3. The icon must be exactly 32x32 pixels.
/
/             4. The icon can only have 256 colors.
/
/             5. The icon must be submitted in BMP or 
/                GIF format.
/             
/             6. We must be wary of any copyright
/                infringement. Do not use Dragonlance
/                materials.
/
/
/     A thread named Arctic Icons will be started on the
/   forums (mud.arctic.org/forums), where you can post and 
/   comment on various icons that are submitted. We will
/   likely be letting our anonymous donor pick a favorite.
/
