The old man blinks as you appear, then sighs so profoundly that you feel
distinctly uncomfortable. "Oh no, no no no," he stutters, then seemingly
begins listening to a voice that you can't here. "It's done, he's already
sensed the portal now lies open."

Once again, the old man sighs, the looks at you and frowns.

The adventurer standing quietly next to him puts his hand on the
white-robed man's shoulder and says, "We knew this day would come, old
friend, and I know what needs to be done. This time Samus sleeps forever."

Returning the gesture and gripping his shoulder tightly, the white-robed
old man says, "I had hoped it would never come, Walker, but indeed you have
the right of it." Looking you over once more as if sizing you up, the old
man says, "Assuming you are successful, we'll have a chat about why you
feel the need to go around opening portals to the Abyss for no apparent
reason."

Grabbing a large floppy hat blowing by your feet, the white-robed figure
vanishes, leaving only a small cloud of white feathers floating to the
ground in his wake.

Walker stares hard at the white rune, then pulls out a strange looking
device from his deep worn should sack and waves it in front of the rune. As
you watch perplexed, you hear a slight whine then a click, and the rune
flares white and begins glowing.

Walker smiles thinly then says in a hushed voice "Aye, we're committed now,
me friends. To fully unlock the crypt, one of you pure goody types needs to
work that rune now. I'd do it, but, err," he stammers, then oddly blushes

exa corpseThe death cry of Lord Samus echoes from somewhere nearby...
As the death knight falls to the floor, his body smoking, a loud *CRACK!*
throws you to your knees. Looking up you see that the funeral bier in the
center of the room has cracked completely in half, revealing a large white
portal.

Stunned and tired, you jump again as a voice, as if carried by a nonexistant
wind, fills the room.

"Aye, next time I get the wanderlust to travel the planes, I think instead
I'll just sit back down and have another swig," Walker's voice chuckles.
"Well no matter, death's not always as permanent as you might be inclined
to believe. You all have done well, my friends, very well indeed. Now
before Darkie starts wondering why her favorite avatar just vanished, I'd
be moving outta that crypt faster'n a, well, a mortal in the Abyss,
anyways.

"The old man wanted me to extend his thanks as well, and give you a gift.
He apologizes for not being able to talk to you in person, but you know
those types," Walker snorts. "He said to take this gift, and the next time
you think about opening portals to the Abyss for no good reason, beat
yourself with it."

Fading laughter echoes around the crypt for a while as a small white
feather falls to the floor.
Lord Samus's corpse disintegrates instantly!
