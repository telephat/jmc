peace begins to emanate outward from the altar to the surrounding gardens

    The northern end of the Deep Mine Main Way has led to this well used,
easily operated mining lift. The lift, obviously a product of the
engineering guild, has taken the miners and pyromancers of deep mine into
the mines successfully and safely for many years. Its double-shafted
structure allows quick access and movement of the lift. As one lift is up,
the other is always down. Working miners gather together taking the lift
down into the mines. Pyromancers do the same| yet stay quietly to
themselves with much smaller numbers. Mining carts ritualistically move
into and out of the lifts. The room is lit by stakes of light cemented into
the ground. The south is the only way back to the village.
