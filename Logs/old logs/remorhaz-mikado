314H 140V 1X 20072C Mem:1 Exits:D> help shamanA shaman is a tribal spiritualist, a master of the natural elements as well
as contact with spirits and a tribe's ancestry. As such, shamans can be found
among the wild races as well as among human communities living in remote and 
isolated areas. Shamans, alone of all other classes, have an innate ability 
to see into the spirit world, and have the power to force spirits of fallen 
monsters to assist them or their comrades in a number of ways.

Shamans are powerful in combat, relying primarily on their weapons to inflict 
damage upon their opponents. The main focus of their magical abilities, 
however, is to defend, protect and strengthen themselves and those who 
journey with them. In addition, shamans have medical abilities which, 
although inferior to those of a cleric, allow them to assist in the curing of 
wounds and other ailments.

Although shamans maintain close ties with the spirit world, they abhor the 
undead, perceiving them as a perversion of nature, and will often go out of
their way to help eliminate them.

While all ability scores are of importance to a shaman, the most significant
to a shaman's innate abilities are charisma, intelligence and constitution.

Early Skills:
axes                    bandage                 bludgeons
hex                     miscellaneous           piercers
short blades

NOTE: Later skills must be learned about through playing the class.

Allowable Races:
human     wild elf     goblin       minotaur     gully dwarf

Alignment Restrictions:
none

416H 136V 8274229X 2022C Exits:N> help spiritAlthough spirits are part of the arcane lore of Krynn, their exact nature
remains unknown and constitutes a matter of endless debate among the 
scholars. Some claim they are the souls of dead people that remain in our
world, unable to "move on"| for others, they are extraplanar entities that
manifest in places of strong emotional turmoil and assume the semblance and
characteristics of the recently deceased| yet another school of thought 
views spirits as creations of the Gods guised in a form familiar to the
denizens of Krynn.

Whatever their true nature, it is a fact that spirits usually appear near
locations where violent death has occured and strongly resemble the recently
deceased. However, their bond to our world is weak and their presence goes
unnoticed by most| only the Shamans, touched by the ancestral spirits of
their tribes, may employ their magic and draw them fully to our world. Once
manifested physically, spirits are able to interact normally with the mortal
plane.

416H 136V 8274229X 2022C Exits:N> help auras
Auras are a special kind of area spells. They affect all members of their
target's group, as long as they remain in the same room with the target.
Contrary to normal area spells, auras will also affect people who joined the 
group after their casting.

Aura effects are not cumulative: group members under the effect of several 
auras of the same kind will only benefit from one of them.

This command will list your skills and your proficiency at them. Your
proficiency is how well you know the skill based on the amount that your
guild can advance in that skill. Here are the names of such qualifiers, in
order:

        awful, bad, very poor, poor, below average, average,
        fair, good, very good, excellent, superb, superior

Note that these qualifiers are very broad, and are spread over the entire
range of abilities in that skill. The qualifier is relative to the absolute
maximum for your guild in that skill, and not relative to what you can
achieve at your level. Some categories are unattainable in some skills.
Some guilds are far more knowledgeable in certain skills than other guilds|
a skill listed as "average" for one guild might be more advanced than that
skill at "excellent" for another. It is not necessarily the case that when
a guildmaster instructs you that you will raise a category.

You may get help on any skill which you know by using "help skill <name>"
where <name> is the name of the skill you want help for.
